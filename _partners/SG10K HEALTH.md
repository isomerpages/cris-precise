SG10K_Health is the headline project of the Singapore National Precision Medicine programme (NPM Phase I). Comprising 10,000 whole-genome sequences from healthy Chinese, Indian, and Malay consented volunteers. SG10K_Health involved a research collaboration across multiple institutions in Singapore, enabling the country to develop the necessary infrastructure and deep capabilities to process, store, and analyse genetic data at the population scale in a safe, secure, and rapid manner. SG10K_Health provides near complete assessment of common genetic variants in Singaporeâ€™s three major ethnic groups, which can be used by clinicians to better manage Asian patients with genetic disease and as a control data set to compare against disease studies. Work is ongoing to link the SG10K_Health genomic data to research traits (e.g., height, weight, blood pressure) and clinical records.

**Data Access**  
The National Precision Medicine Data Access Committee (NPM DAC) has been established to oversee access to the SG10K_Health datasets to ensure:

*   Data is used appropriately according to NPM terms and conditions, including adherence to informed consent forms and ethical approvals for the data in question.
*   Data users are qualified investigators embedded within a recognised research-intensive organisation.

Interested applicants are highly recommended to read through the data access policies and data access forms via the the [SG10K_Health portal.](https://npm.a-star.edu.sg/help/)
