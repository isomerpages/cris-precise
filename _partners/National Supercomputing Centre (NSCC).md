The National Supercomputing Centre (NSCC) Singapore was established in 2015 and manages Singapore’s national petascale facilities with available high-performance computing (HPC) resources. As a National Research Infrastructure funded by the National Research Foundation (NRF), we support the HPC research needs of the public and private sectors, including research institutes, institutes of higher learning, government agencies and companies. With the support of its stakeholders, including Agency for Science Technology and Research (A\*STAR), Nanyang Technological University (NTU), National University of Singapore (NUS), Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), National Environment Agency (NEA) and Technology Centre for Offshore and Marine, Singapore (TCOMS),&nbsp;NSCC&nbsp;catalyses national research and development initiatives, attracts industrial research collaborations and enhances Singapore’s research capabilities.
<br><br>
NSCC&nbsp;supports the National Precision Medicine Programme by providing its HPC resources and data storage capabilities to enable the team to&nbsp;deploy state-of-the-art genome analytics algorithms at an industrial scale to uncover the genetic variants of each individual.
