### Evidence Empower Decisions

			<td style="width:50%">
The Health Intervention and Policy Evaluation Research unit, HIPER, was launched by the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health in January 2019. HIPER’s vision, “Evidence Empower Decisions”, was established with the aim to grow Health Technology Assessment (HTA) capacity for healthcare priority-setting in developing countries. Our efforts to build HTA capacity include a range of activities, including consulting services and advisory work, development of software tools to support HTA research, education, and networking at domestic and international levels.

				We believe that&nbsp;<b>better evidence</b>&nbsp;can be generated only through better research capacity. Eventually, these evidence will&nbsp;<b>empower decision-making</b>&nbsp;resulting in sustainable health systems.

**Our work**

HIPER’s areas of expertise include HTA, Health Economics, Health Services Research and Global Health. As part of our global efforts in building HTA capacity, HIPER has provided its expertise to partners regionally and internationally, including Thailand, India, Indonesia, Philippines, Laos and Kenya. As part of such efforts, HIPER organises trainings and events to build HTA capacity for governments, funding agencies, NGOs and other stakeholder organisations in a wide range of areas such as HTA, econometric techniques and applied research methods in public health.

One example of global collaboration facilitated by HIPER is the development of the&nbsp;**Use of Real-World Data and Real-World Evidence to Support Drug Reimbursement Decision-Making in Asia&nbsp;(**REALISE) guidance document through an interactive consultative process with global experts and 11 Asian health systems. The document provides a framework that generates and uses real-world data (RWD) / real-world evidence (RWE) as complementary evidence to randomized controlled trials (RCTs), in a consistent and efficient manner for decision-making in Asia.

HIPER currently focuses on&nbsp;**four disease areas**&nbsp;within healthcare research: Mental Health and Wellbeing, Chronic Kidney Disease, Precision Medicine, and Antimicrobial Resistance. We’ve refined our skills and built a strong multi-disciplinary team to approach our research areas in&nbsp;**three ways**: Early Health Technology Assessment (HTA), Real-world Evidence, and Value-based Care.

**Our partners**

HIPER is part of the International Decision Support Initiative (iDSI), a network of institutions with health, policy and economic expertise who support countries in scaling up HTA capacity to facilitate evidence-informed decision making. As a member of iDSI, HIPER strives to work with the network partners to support countries to make better decisions about how much public money to spend on healthcare and how to make that money go further.

In line with our mission to build HTA capacity, HIPER has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Centre for Innovation in Healthcare (CIH) in Singapore to facilitate building up CIH’s HTA capacity and supporting local innovators that require HTA expertise/research to assess their suitability for clinical adoption.
