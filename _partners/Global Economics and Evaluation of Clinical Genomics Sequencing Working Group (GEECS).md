### Improving methods used for assessing value and implementation of precision medicine

The Global Economics and Evaluation of Clinical Genomics Sequencing Working Group (GEECS), founded in 2017, aims to improve the methods used for assessing the value and implementation of new genomic technologies – specifically, clinical genomics testing using next-generation sequencing (NGS). GEECS includes an esteemed group of health economists and policy researchers from major institutions across the globe who have been at the forefront of the incorporation of genomics into clinical care. The Working Group includes the founding members as well as affiliated members who provide a range of perspectives from different disciplines and countries.
<br>
​GEECS has led several collaborations resulting in a series of publications in Value in Health, Health Affairs, and JAMA. These articles address challenges in assessing the value and implementation of NGS, and suggest innovative solutions to move the value assessment process forward for precision medicine. These recommendations can be applied not only by health economics researchers, but also by other stakeholders including health technology assessment organizations, payers, clinical researchers, and the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries.
<br>
​GEECS first published several theme issues and journal themed sections in 2018 on assessing the value of precision medicine and next-generation sequencing tests. In 2020, GEECS focused on moving the evaluation of precision medicine into practice, resulting in a themed section and a JAMA paper on the global availability and funding of clinical genomic sequencing. GEECS is continuing its work on value assessment with an emphasis on building the necessary infrastructure for use across the globe.
