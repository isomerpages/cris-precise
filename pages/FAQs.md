**1. HOW CAN I PARTICIPATE IN THE NATIONAL PRECISION MEDICINE PROGRAMME?**

We are working with the SG100K study to bring participants into the precision medicine programme. SG100K is a state-of-the-art population health research study, established as a collaboration between leading researchers at Singapore’s National Universities and hospitals. SG100K is coordinated by Professor John Chambers at LKC Medicine, NTU. Participation in SG100K involves completing a consent form and providing blood for genomic sequencing and biological samples for a range of other analyses. The team will also ask you for your permission to access your health records and other questions about your health and lifestyle to help us understand how these factors influence Singaporeans’ health.
