<p><strong>Patient Story: Living With Familial Hypercholesterolemia</strong>
</p>
<p><strong><em>“All these years we just thought it was high cholesterol. We never imagined it was something genetic.”</em></strong>
</p>
<p>For more than three decades, <em>Patient A</em> (a healthcare professional)
lived by the book when it came to health. No alcohol. No smoking. A diet
carefully balanced to be low in cholesterol. To anyone looking in, she
appeared to be doing everything right to protect her health.</p>
<p>Her family history told a different story. Her mother, uncles and aunt
had all been diagnosed with high cholesterol in their 40s. Despite strict
diets, five of them eventually succumbed to heart failure in their 50s
and 60s. “Only making lifestyle changes was not enough,” she reflects.</p>
<p>The turning point came last year, when her daughter — still in her twenties
— went for a routine health screening at work. High cholesterol was detected,
and she was referred to FHCARE, a clinical <a href="https://www.npm.sg/news-and-events/editorial-features/getting-to-the-heart-of-the-matter/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">research programme</a> supported
by PRECISE, at Khoo Teck Puat Hospital (KTPH). Genetic testing confirmed
her daughter had familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) — a genetic condition
that affects how the body manages cholesterol.</p>
<p>“At first, I was stunned,” <em>Patient A</em> recalls. “All these years
we just thought it was high cholesterol. We never imagined it was something
genetic.”</p>
<p>Encouraged by her daughter’s diagnosis, she underwent testing herself.
In February, she too was diagnosed with FH. The news landed harder than
expected. “Even though I wasn’t surprised, my anxiety doubled,” she says.
“Why? How? What now? I did not even know what I needed to know.”</p>
<p>That was when support from the FHCARE team became invaluable. With guidance
from doctors and genetic counsellors, she learned about the importance
of <strong>cascade screening</strong> — the practice of testing family members
of an affected individual — and began medication early. She was also connected
to the FH Advocacy Circle, a support group where families living with FH
share experiences and access reliable information.</p>
<p>“Understanding the genetic aspect helps us make sense of FH, which is
a chronic condition,” she explains. “It meant my daughter and I could act
decisively, rather than rely only on lifestyle changes, which had not been
enough for my uncles and aunt.”</p>
<p>Today, <em>Patient A</em> is thriving. Her condition is stable, and she
only needs to attend follow-ups every nine months. More importantly, she
has become an <strong>FH ambassador</strong>, helping to build a supportive
community for patients and families.</p>
<p>“The unknown can be fearful,” she says. “But there’s no need to avoid
it.”</p>
