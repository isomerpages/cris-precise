##### 1.  What is the National Precise Medicine (NPM) Programme?

The NPM Programme is a national research effort in Singapore. It studies how our genes (DNA), lifestyle, and environment affect health. This knowledge can help doctors move from "one-size-fits-all" care to more precise healthcare including preventive care, earlier screening, and closer monitoring for those at higher risk of developing for those at higher risk of developing genetic conditions. The goal is to keep people healthier for longer, not just treat disease after it develops.

##### 2. What does "precision medicine" mean?

Precision medicine is about using science and data to improve health for both individuals and populations. By studying genetic, lifestyle, and environmental factors across large groups of people and understanding the differences, doctors and researchers can design better ways to prevent disease, detect conditions earlier, and guide treatments more effectively. In this way, precision medicine strengthens public health while also supporting more tailored and more targeted healthcare when needed.

##### 3. Why is Singapore doing this?

Every population is different. Most genetic research has been done on Western populations. Singapore’s diverse Asian population gives us a chance to discover important insights that are directly relevant to our communities, and to improve healthcare here at home.

##### 4. What is Phase III of NPM about?

Phase III is the biggest stage yet, involving up to 450,000 residents. Unlike earlier phases with healthy volunteers, this phase includes patients in hospitals. Studying patients allows researchers to see how genes affect real diseases, test new approaches in clinical care, and make findings more useful for preventive care and everyday healthcare in Singapore.

##### 5. How can I participate?

Enrolment for NPM Phase III has not started yet. You can register your interest by emailing contact@precise.cris.sg. When enrolment begins, and if you meet the participation criteria, our hospital partners will contact you. Please check [**www.npm.sg**](https://www.npm.sg/) for the latest updates.

##### 6.What will participants be asked to do?

Singaporean residents participating in NPM Phase III will be invited to donate a small blood sample to read your genetic code. You will also you will also be asked to give permission for researchers to look at your medical records (with personal details removed), this helps scientists understand how genes, health conditions, and treatments are linked.

##### 7.Will I receive my genetic test results?

Currently, individual participant genetic results are not routinely returned to participants. The focus of this programme is on research to benefit the broader Singapore population rather than individual diagnosis. However, if researchers discover something important for your health during the study, there are processes in place to inform you through a genetic counsellor or your doctor.

##### 8.Is my personal information safe?

Yes. Personal details like your name or NRIC are removed from the start, and all data is stored securely in Singapore. Only approved researchers working on projects that aim to improve healthcare for Singaporeans can access it under strict rules. Importantly, they will never know that the data belongs to you specifically. Participants also choose how their data may be used, and can opt out of future use at any time. These safeguards ensure privacy while allowing research to benefit public health.

##### 9. Will this affect my insurance?

No. The [Ministry of Health](https://www.moh.gov.sg/others/resources-and-statistics/moratorium-on-genetic-testing-and-insurance) and the Life Insurance Association of Singapore have agreed that genetic test results from research like NPM cannot be used to decide your insurance coverage or premiums.

##### 10.What are the benefits of joining?

By joining, you help doctors and scientists understand how health and disease affect people like us in Singapore. This knowledge can lead to earlier screening, better prevention, and more effective treatments in our hospitals and clinics. Even if you don’t benefit right away, your contribution will help improve care for your family, friends, and future generations.

##### 11.What is genomic sequencing?

Genomic sequencing is like creating a detailed map of all the~n~ genes in your DNA. This map shows the tiny differences in genes (genetic variants) from person to person. These tiny differences influence your physical characteristics, how you respond to food and medications, your environment, and your risk of developing diseases. Having these genetic maps from many Singaporeans will help researchers study how diseases develop and design more targeted treatments.

##### 12.How can I get prescribed precision medicine?**

Precision medicine is not available over the counter. Rather, precision medicine is an approach that uses results from genetic tests to help doctors put together a care plan with very specific recommendations. In some cases, precision medicine can help make a more accurate diagnosis and improve treatment. In other cases, it can help people opt for earlier screening tests and other prevention steps if they are at risk for a particular disease.

Currently, precision medicine approaches such as genetic testing are being used to diagnose some inherited cancers, inherited high cholesterol and rare diseases. NPM is doing research to expand the types of medical conditions that can benefit from precision medicine approaches.
