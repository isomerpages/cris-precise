##### 1.  What is the National Precise Medicine (NPM) Programme?

The NPM Programme is a national research effort in Singapore. It studies how our genes (DNA), lifestyle, and environment affect health. This knowledge can help doctors move from "one-size-fits-all" care to more precise healthcare including preventive care, earlier screening, and closer monitoring for those at higher risk of developing for those at higher risk of developing genetic conditions. The goal is to keep people healthier for longer, not just treat disease after it develops.

##### 2. What does "precision medicine" mean?

Precision medicine is about using science and data to improve health for both individuals and populations. By studying genetic, lifestyle, and environmental factors across large groups of people and understanding the differences, doctors and researchers can design better ways to prevent disease, detect conditions earlier, and guide treatments more effectively. In this way, precision medicine strengthens public health while also supporting more tailored and more targeted healthcare when needed.

##### 3. Why is Singapore doing this?

Every population is different. Most genetic research has been done on Western populations. Singaporeâ€™s diverse Asian population gives us a chance to discover important insights that are directly relevant to our communities, and to improve healthcare here at home.

##### 4. What is Phase III of NPM about?

Phase III is the biggest stage yet, involving up to 450,000 residents. Unlike earlier phases with healthy volunteers, this phase includes patients in hospitals. Studying patients allows researchers to see how genes affect real diseases, test new approaches in clinical care, and make findings more useful for preventive care and everyday healthcare in Singapore.

##### 5. How can I participate?

Enrolment for NPM Phase III has not started yet. You can register your interest by emailing contact@precise.cris.sg. When enrolment begins, and if you meet the participation criteria, our hospital partners will contact you. Please check [**www.npm.sg**](https://www.npm.sg/) for the latest updates.

##### 6. What will participants be asked to do?

Singaporean residents participating in NPM Phase III will be invited to donate a small blood sample to read your genetic code. You will also you will also be asked to give permission for researchers to look at your medical records (with personal details removed), this helps scientists understand how genes, health conditions, and treatments are linked.

##### 7.Will I receive my genetic test results?

Currently, individual participant genetic results are not routinely returned to participants. The focus of this programme is on research to benefit the broader Singapore population rather than individual diagnosis. However, if researchers discover something important for your health during the study, there are processes in place to inform you through a genetic counsellor or your doctor.

**Is my personal information safe?**

The programme spans 10 years. We have completed the first phase, in which we studied the genomes of 10,000 Singaporeans and identified common genetic variants (&gt;1%) that occur in the Singaporean population. In the next few years, we hope to collect data from 100,000 Singaporeans to reveal more uniquely Singaporean insights into the roles of genetic variants in disease. Another important focus will be testing precision medicine pilot programmes in real hospital settings. In the long run, we also hope to train future generations of skilled workers in the high-growth genomics and big data industries, who will help to propel Singapore to the forefront of precision medicine worldwide.
