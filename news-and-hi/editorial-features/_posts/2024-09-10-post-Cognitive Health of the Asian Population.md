<p>The prevalence of poor mental health in Singapore has increased from 13.4%
in 2020 to 17% in 2022<sup>1</sup>, according to the National Population
Health Survey 2022. In another survey by the National University of Singapore
in 2022, findings revealed that about one in three youth&nbsp;in Singapore
has reported internalising mental health symptoms such as sadness, anxiety
and loneliness<sup>2</sup>. Amidst this growing concern, Singapore launched
a national mental health and well-being strategy on 4 October 2023, which
adopted a multi-pronged approach to tackle mental health issues<sup>3</sup>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At the frontline of cognitive genomic precision medicine is Assistant
Professor Max Lam, Deputy Science Director for Precision Health Research,
Singapore (PRECISE)’s <a href="https://www.npm.sg/partners/precise-sg100k" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>PRECISE-SG100K study</u></a><sup>4</sup>,
and the Principal Investigator of the <u>CO</u>gnitive functio<u>N</u>&nbsp;in
psy<u>C</u>hiatric <u>I</u>llnes<u>SE</u>s (CONCISE) mental health study
at Institute of Mental Health. Also leading the PRECISE-SG100K Cognitive
Health Flagship Project, Dr Lam and his team are looking to contribute
towards the field through introducing novel treatment strategies for cognitive-related
disabilities and identifying segments of patients amenable to specific
treatment strategies.</p>
<h4><strong>Challenges in Studying Cognitive Genetics</strong></h4>
<p>Dr Lam shared, “During my early years as a psychologist working with patients
and their families, I noticed that many patients faced significant cognitive
challenges. While psychiatric medications were effective in managing symptoms,
they often did not improve cognitive function. This observation highlighted
a critical gap in treatment and inspired me to explore solutions that could
better address cognitive difficulties in psychiatric patients.”</p>
<p>Dr Lam’s search for a solution led him to deep dive into the biology underpinning
these issues, and ultimately, the emerging field of genetics. Dr Lam said,
“In 2010, large-scale precision medicine efforts were nascent. Hence, while
our research effort was considered ambitious then, it was modest by the
standards of precision medicine today. More importantly, it was clear that
if we want to answer the question ‘Are there any drug targets that can
help address cognitive issues?’, we would need to look into the genetic
architecture of psychiatric illness as well as how genetics might be associated
with cognitive function in the normal population.”</p>
<p>It proved to be challenging to study cognition in clinical populations
because findings could be impacted by clinical interventions such as medicine
and treatments. “To overcome the problem, we studied healthy people instead.
We looked at their cognitive function and how their genetics predict cognitive
function. Concurrently, we also studied the genetics of psychiatric illness.
By merging both research streams and locating the intersection for these
two groups, we have found some genes that are likely associated with cognition
and illness. The next step would be to identify, within this smaller subset
of genes, which would make good drug targets for rescuing cognitive function
in mental illness,” Dr Lam explained.</p>
<h4><strong>The Case for Large-scale Cognitive Genomics Analyses</strong></h4>
<p>Despite making positive progress, Dr Lam's journey is far from nearing
its end. He said, “We are just about to drill into the exciting part. Unlike
medical conditions like Huntington’s disease or Spinal Muscular Atrophy
(SMA) where clear genetic signals exist, the genetic architecture of psychiatric
illnesses is much more complex. That means no one biomarker or gene is
solely responsible for the disease—it’s likelier that hundreds or even
thousands of genes are relevant. With the PRECISE-SG100K study and the
large number of phenotype data points we are getting from each consented
participant, we can begin to develop and examine the use of genetic risk
scores in cognitive and mental health for the first time.”</p>
<p>The availability of a polygenic risk score not only holds the promise
of opportunities for early disease intervention and prevention but also
reduces healthcare costs for both the patient and the healthcare system.
Dr Lam elaborated, “Present treatment guidelines for schizophrenia do not
differentiate patient profiles, but some patients do not respond to first-
and second-line antipsychotic treatments—they are generally more ill with
more disability and have a higher rate of hospitalisations. Recently, we
found that polygenic risk scores are potentially helpful in identifying
patients with treatment resistance. We are now trying to validate this
finding.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>The Importance of Translating Knowledge into Clinical Practice</strong></h4>
<p>Having been in psychiatric research for over a decade, Dr Lam knows that
groundbreaking research findings matter only when translated into clinical
practice. “The development and findings from these large-scale studies
are not translating fast enough into the clinical settings. Rather than
treating patients symptomatically with drugs, if we could leverage genetics
to impact therapy strategy and treatment outcomes, we would gain an extra
arsenal in our battle against mental illnesses,” said Dr Lam.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The potential impact is substantial, offering benefits to both the healthcare
system and patients. Dr Lam noted, “Clinicians are highly skilled in diagnosing
conditions like schizophrenia and depression, but additional insights into
how a patient might respond to specific treatments or their likely diagnostic
journey over time would be invaluable. For example, understanding whether
a patient initially presenting with anxiety disorder might develop other
conditions such as severe depression, early psychosis, or bipolar disorder,
could greatly enhance personalised treatment plans. While some patients
may experience a stable clinical trajectory, these predictive insights
are currently limited for many clinicians.”</p>
<p>Dr Lam continued, “The answers however could be found in genetics. That
is why we are hoping to put together a mental health study (CONCISE) of
10,000 individuals using parallel technologies that PRECISE-SG100K is using
so that we can carry out data comparison and scale it alongside the National
Precision Medicine (NPM) programme. We are also exploring the possibility
of monitoring cognition fluctuations in real time through wearables—then
mapping this information back to genetics to see if there are any genetic
predictors for cognition profiles.”</p>
<h4><strong>The Future of Cognitive Disorders in the Asian Population</strong></h4>
<p>Dr Lam notes that PRECISE-SG100K is the only large-scale Asian national
effort systematically collecting cognitive data. He elaborated, “None of
the Asian biobanks or precision medicine cohorts is collecting cognitive
and whole genome sequencing data at this scale; with PRECISE-SG100K, there
is a huge opportunity for Singapore to lead in the field.”</p>
<p>“In addition, there is increasing evidence that cognitive function is
linked to other health ailments like diabetes and cardiometabolic health.
Given that we are collecting detailed and comprehensive data on other health
variables and phenotypes in PRECISE-SG100K, we are in a strong position
to systematically delve into how physical health, psychopathology, cognition,
and genetics interface with one another. With that understanding, we can
then treat and prevent diseases in a more holistic manner,” said Dr Lam.</p>
<p>Dr Lam said, “Years on—I am still passionate about finding the answer
to my first question, ‘Do we have drugs or therapy to rescue ability-related
cognitive problems?’ I hope that the first drug for rescuing cognitive
function could be discovered in Singapore.”
