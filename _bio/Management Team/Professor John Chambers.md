<p><strong>Professor John Chambers</strong> is Chief Scientific Officer (CSO)
of PRECISE, the central entity established to implement Phase II and Phase
III of Singapore’s National Precision Medicine strategy. Prof Chambers
is the lead investigator of the PRECISE-SG100K population cohort study,
a multi-institutional effort that aims to study the genetic makeup of 100,000
healthy Singaporeans and specific disease cohorts. The genetic data will
be integrated with detailed lifestyle, environmental, and clinical data
to yield rich insights into factors that contribute to Asian diseases and
conditions.</p>
<p>Prof Chambers’ own research focuses on identification of mechanisms underlying
the high rate of cardiovascular disease and diabetes in Asian populations
and translational research to improve prevention and control of these major
diseases. He has been closely involved in large-scale prospective population
studies in Europe, South Asia and Singapore. His research has contributed
to the discovery of novel genetic and epigenetic pathways associated with
coronary heart disease, type-2 diabetes, obesity, and related metabolic
disturbances implicating new molecular pathways underlying these diseases.</p>
<p>As Professor of Cardiovascular Epidemiology at LKCMedicine, Prof Chambers
will continue to focus on identifying new strategies for prediction and
prevention of cardiovascular disease and diabetes. He also aims to aspire
a new generation of researchers who will continue his efforts in identifying
novel ways to predict and prevent cardiovascular diseases and diabetes.
He hopes to achieve these through the research networks he has established
in the region, the research platform at LKCMedicine and partner healthcare
organisations.</p>
