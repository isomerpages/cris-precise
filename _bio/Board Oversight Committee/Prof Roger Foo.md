**Roger Foo** is the inaugural chair holder of the Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan Professorship of Medicine at the National University of Singapore (NUS), Director of the NUHS Cardiovascular Disease Translational Research Programme, Senior Consultant at the National University Heart Centre Singapore (NUHCS) where he is Clinical Lead for the Cardiac Genetics Service, Deputy Director at the Cardiovascular Research Institute (CVRI), and Senior Group Leader at the A\*STAR Genome Institute of Singapore (GIS). He is now also Vice-Dean (Research) at the NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine.

Upon graduation at NUS, Roger undertook his post-graduate clinical training at King College Hospital London and Addenbrooke’s Hospital Cambridge. For his research training, he worked in the labs of the late Professor David de Bono (British Heart Foundation Chair of Cardiology, Leicester), Professor Morris Brown (past president British Hypertension Society, and Professor of Clinical Pharmacology, Cambridge), Professor Martin Bennett (BHF Chair of Cardiovascular Sciences, Cambridge) and Professor Rick Kitsis (The Dr. Gerald and Myra Dorros Chair in Cardiovascular Disease, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, NYC), where he was continuously funded by both The Welcome Trust and the British Heart Foundation with fellowships and project grants.

Altogether, Roger trained and worked in Cambridge, UK, for over 20 years at the Division of Cardiovascular Medicine (University of Cambridge) and also at the Addenbrooke’s Hospital NHS Trust before moving his lab to Singapore in 2013. Here, he has come to establish Singapore’s first Cardiac Genetics clinical service, and has since been leading in the Cardiovascular Epigenomics and Molecular Epigenetics Themes for many of the largest Cardiovascular grant awards in the country. His clinical practice is based at the NUHS National University Heart Centre, and his labs are at the NUS MD6 Centre for Translational Medicine, and A\*STAR Genome Institute.

Research in the lab makes use of genomic technology to study the cardiac epigenome and hunt for novel Heart Failure mechanisms. Roger enjoys reading scientific, historical and current affairs literature. He keeps as much as possible to a daily swimming regime, and uses WhatsApp and Instagram to keep up with the dizzy lives of his grown-up children who live abroad.
