<p>Delve into the tranformative journey from the National Precision Medicine
(NPM) datasets to the development of a customised genetic test to screen
for common severe recessive diseases among Singaporeans. Witness first-hand
how its implementation can potentially make a tangible difference to patient
care and outcomes.</p>
<p>The event will also mark a strategic partnership between Precision Health
Research, Singapore (PRECISE) and Diagnostics Development Hub (DxD Hub),
a national platform hosted by A*STAR. This partnership is dedicated to
productising diagnostics based on data insights and discoveries from the
Singapore National Precision Medicine (NPM) programme.</p>
<p>This session also serves as an industry networking and engagement opportunity,
bringing together Innovation and Enterprise (I&amp;E) units and industry
partners within the diagnostics and medtech sectors.</p>
