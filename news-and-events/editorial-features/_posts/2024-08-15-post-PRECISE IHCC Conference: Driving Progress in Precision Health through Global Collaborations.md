<p>Three days. Over 50 speakers from more than 15 countries. The inaugural
2024 PRECISE-IHCC Conference sets out to offer delegates an opportunity
to learn about wide-ranging topics, from genetic counselling to rare diseases.
That is not all—one can also look forward to engaging in discourse ranging
from population health to research in limited resource settings and ethics
and policy.</p>
<p>Jointly organised by Precision Health Research, Singapore (PRECISE) and
the International Health Cohorts Consortium (IHCC), the Conference themed
“<a href="https://www.preciseihcc-conference.sg/about/conference/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">From Cohorts to Clinics: The New Landscape of Global Healthcare</a>”
will bring together more than 500 international thought leaders, clinicians,
scientists, biotech experts, and patient advocacy associations at the forefront
of precision medicine and public health innovation.</p>
<p>Mr Peter Goodhand, Co-Chair of IHCC and CEO of the Global Alliance for
Genomics and Health (GA4GH), said, “The 2024 PRECISE-IHCC Conference is
significant in many ways. Following several years of virtual gatherings,
this is IHCC’s first large in-person conference after the pandemic and
our first time hosting in Asia. International collaboration is imperative
to advance science and drive positive health outcomes for all, and the
IHCC plans to provide a forum for global conversations at events on each
continent.”</p>
<p>He continued, “The Conference has an impressive line-up of speakers and
moderators, which is a result of the joint outreach efforts of both PRECISE
and IHCC. Drawing on our strong connection with the scientific community
and industry, PRECISE and IHCC have worked to collectively engage a diverse
group of local and international attendees.”</p>
<p><strong>Providing a Platform for Sharing and Learning</strong>
</p>
<p>The three-day Conference promises to be rewarding and enriching for the
attendees. Dr Ricardo A. Verdugo, a member from the 2024 PRECISE-IHCC Conference
Scientific Committee, shared, “The team worked closely to curate a line-up
that encompasses a wide spectrum of topics. There are going to be sessions
both for attendees interested in basic research and how findings are translated
to the bedside. Additionally, the scientific committee put up various parallel
tracks with non-overlapping topics—so that at any given time participants
can find at least one session that is of interest to them.</p>
<p>“Another notable consideration when inviting speakers for the Conference
is that we consciously made an effort to not just include renowned and
experienced experts in epidemiology, genetics, bioinformatics and clinical
sciences. We also provide young investigators attending the event with
opportunities to present their work. By doing so, we hope to create a platform
where young investigators can share their knowledge and, at the same time,
facilitate richer learning and knowledge exchange between presenters and
participants,” Dr Verdugo explained.</p>
<p>Adding on, Prof Nahla Afifi, another member of the 2024 PRECISE-IHCC Conference
Scientific Committee said, “Each of us has a different journey. We are
either at a different stage in our careers or have a different focus—research,
clinical, policy, ethics, etc. The same applies for the organisations we
are with. Take the biobanks and population-based cohort studies for example—while
some may be more established or larger, they can certainly benefit from
learning experiences of the smaller ones who offer more depth or are more
focused.”
<br>Prof Afifi, who is also a Senior Director at Qatar Biobank, elaborated,
“Personally, I am looking forward to learning from PRECISE, particularly
their experience in managing and fostering strong collaborative ties with
their academic and industry partners. Hopefully, we can bring back that
knowledge and adapt it to strengthen the growth of Qatar Biobank.”</p>
<p><strong>Creating Opportunities for Finding Solutions Together</strong>
</p>
<p>Prof Afifi is not alone in her sentiments. Dr Verdugo said, “Conferences
like such are not only important for driving positive outcomes in developed
and high-income countries, but also middle- and low-income ones. They provide
opportunities for these countries to engage and even contribute towards
the precision medicine cause—they are game changing.”</p>
<p>“The Conference offers an opportunity for people to learn from each other,
address collective challenges and explore effective use cases.” Mr Goodhand
observed. “We have seen when health initiatives are challenged with However,
there are also models that we can spotlight, for instance, Singapore’s
National Precision Medicine (NPM) programme, which aims to transform healthcare
through data-driven healthcare, improve patient outcomes and capture economic
value.&nbsp;With attendees and speakers coming from different backgrounds,
the upcoming Conference is going to provide a very fertile ground for people
to connect, potentially sparking innovative ideas and foster the beginnings
of new collaborations.”</p>
<p>“I can’t agree more with Ricardo and Peter. When you bring a group of
people who are so professional and passionate about what they are doing
together, you can expect a lot of good to come out of it. For one, I am
optimistic that there will be a synergy of ideas and innovations emerging
from this Conference,” smiled Prof Afifi.</p>
<p><strong>Empowering Advances in Global Healthcare</strong>
</p>
<p>“Our hope is for the conversations and ideas started at the 2024 PRECISE-IHCC
Conference to translate into actionable collaboration,” Mr Goodhand said.
“Our ultimate goal is to make a positive impact within the global healthcare
landscape.”</p>
