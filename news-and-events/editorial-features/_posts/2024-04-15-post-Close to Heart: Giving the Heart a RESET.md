<p><em>Twenty-three people in Singapore die from cardiovascular disease every day<sup>1</sup>. The situation is expected to worsen from 482 cases of heart attacks per 100,000 population in Singapore in 2025 to 1,418 per 100,000 population by 2050, representing a nearly three-fold increase<sup>2</sup>.&nbsp;</em>

<p>With over two decades of clinical and research experience under his belt,
the Corresponding Principal Investigator of Project RESET, Prof Roger Foo
also holds concurrent portfolios as Head of the NUHS Clinician Scientist
Academy, Director of the Cardiovascular Research Institute under the National
University Heart Centre Singapore (NUHCS), as well as Senior Consultant
in the Department of Cardiology at NUHCS, and the Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan
Professor in Medicine.</p>
<h4><strong>That is an impressive and illustrious list of professional appointments. Could you share more about your journey as a clinician scientist?</strong></h4>
<p>I always like to tell people that my journey is one that is unexpected,
unintentional—but eventful and fulfilling. After completing my studies
at NUS Medicine and serving the National Service, I went to the UK for
my postgraduate clinical training. First at King’s College Hospital in
London, then at Addenbrooke’s Hospital in Cambridge, and eventually, passing
the Membership of the Royal Colleges of Physicians of the United Kingdom
(MRCP(UK)) within a year. Having planned for a two-year no-pay leave originally,
I had a year to spare—so my bosses suggested that I go into the lab and
try my hand at bench research.</p>
<p>Joining the lab of the late David de Bono (British Heart Foundation, and
Chair of Cardiology, University of Leicester) and working alongside the
late Anthony Gershlick gave me first-hand exposure to what it would be
like to pursue a career in research. Subsequent research stints in labs
of Morris Brown (past president British Hypertension Society, and Professor
of Clinical Pharmacology, Cambridge), and Martin Bennett (BHF Chair of
Cardiovascular Sciences, Cambridge) further spurred my research interests.
My research journey was further consolidated by a Wellcome Trust fellowship,
which brought me to Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City,
US, in the lab of Rick Kitsis (the Dr Gerald and Myra Dorros Chair in Cardiovascular
Disease) for two years, and finally landed me back as a Consultant at Addenbrooke’s
Hospital, and a British Heart Foundation Fellow at the University of Cambridge.
Amid these unfolding events, I paid off my bond, finished my PhD, pursued
my postdoctoral fellowship and started my research group as a new group
leader at Cambridge.</p>
<h4><strong>What keeps you passionate about your work as a clinician scientist after all these years?</strong></h4>
<p>When I finally returned to Singapore in 2013, we were at a nascent stage
in biomedical research and technology. The Foo lab was literally among
the first to establish the mouse model of heart disease, training small
animal surgeons to handle operations for mice, and setting up equipment
like ultrasound for mice. Since then, we have been running fast. Our achievements
are especially evident when we compare how research discoveries are made
here. Many of our discoveries stem directly from the population through
collecting and analysing human samples. In contrast to the convention of
starting from the dish or smaller model organisms before being replicated
to see if the same applies to humans. A significant contributor to our
accomplishments today is the systematic and coordinated manner in which
we drive research as a community. An example would be the PRECISE-SG100K
project.</p>
<p>There is so much motivation in Singapore to do right by our population.
As a result, every time we see patients, we are not only thinking about
providing them with the best treatment, but also opportunities presented
by new research findings. Coupled with exciting discoveries—like new genes
and genetic pathways—in the research space every other day, it is hard
to not get excited or be passionate. Imagine rewriting the heart’s gene
programme such that cells in this non-self-healing organ can divide and
regenerate new cells to heal scars from heart attacks—heart disease and
heart failure could become something of the past!</p>
<p>And we are possibly getting nearer to that point—if the recently approved
heart disease medicine, mavacamten, is any measure. Traditionally, all
heart disease patients get the same medicine for their symptoms—and when
one medicine doesn’t work, another medicine would be added, then another.
As a result, many patients end up taking a large host of medicines for
one disease. With mavacamten, a myosin activator, we are using molecular
understanding to offer targeted treatment for the first time. As genetic
discoveries reveal more underpinning basis, targeted treatments and medicines
will increasingly become the norm for cardiovascular diseases. That means—patients
get more efficacious medicines tailored for their genetic make-up.</p>
<h4><strong>Can you tell us more about Project RESET and its significance to improving our population’s cardiovascular health?</strong></h4>
<p>In relation to what I mentioned earlier about a molecular basis for treatment,
it is important that we base our application on relevant and accurate information.
But how can we do that if our development is derived from non-Asian sources?
Did you know—the profile of heart failure patients in Singapore is actually
quite different from heart failure patients in the US, UK and elsewhere
in Europe?</p>
<p>Metabolic diseases such as diabetes are strong contributing factors for
poor cardiovascular health here—not just blocked arteries. That is why
our patients not only tend to present with heart failures at a younger
age, but are also likelier to have metabolic diseases in the background
of heart failure.</p>
<p>Through Project RESET, we are looking to gather health metrics and physical
and lifestyle data of over 10,000 high-risk individuals between 40 and
70 years old from the general population. From there, we would select 3,000
participants for a five-year follow-up programme. We would make use of
technology to track their sleeping habits and physical activities, study
their lifestyle markers and genetics, and analyse the correlation of these
with heart diseases—to obtain a full diagnostic picture of each patient.</p>
<p>And we are not going to stop there. Ultimately, like the PRECISE-SG100K
project, we are working with the team to establish polygenic risk score
assays that are reflective of our population and can be effectively deployed
to healthy Singaporeans, and the wider Asian populations. The goal is to
develop new innovative preventive strategies and make preventive heart
health more accessible and relevant to individuals. To help with achieving
this, we will leverage technologies such as artificial intelligence, mixed
reality and wearables.</p>
<h4><strong>What are your hopes for the future of genetic cardiovascular diseases?</strong></h4>
<p>The science and technology landscape is moving rapidly—and at a complementary
pace to each other. Correspondingly, opportunities for early intervention
and precision medicine are also growing. These are all very exhilarating
for clinicians and scientists. But at the same time, now more than ever,
we confront the issue of ethics especially when we talk about CRISPR—short
for “clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats”—technology
and gene editing. Where does gene editing stop and discrimination starts?
And what should we do to ensure equality and ethicality? I hope we can
collectively figure this out as a community soon.</p>
<p>Personally, I hope some of the genes my research team and I put out there
can help drive better therapeutic outcomes—and we can contribute towards
Healthier SG through providing more precise lifestyle or activity advice
to individuals and enabling them to keep cardiovascular and other diseases
at bay.</p>
