description: About one in 150 Singaporeans has an underlying risk of hereditary
  breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) and one in 500 has an underlying risk of
  Lynch syndrome (LS) according to the recently published findings of
  SG10K_Health study by PRECISE.  However, only the costs of cancer diagnosis
  and treatment are being subsidised currently while diagnostic testing for
  probands and their first-degree relatives (FDRs) are not. A clinical
  implementation pilot supported by Precision Health Research, Singapore
  (PRECISE) is seeking to address this gap.
