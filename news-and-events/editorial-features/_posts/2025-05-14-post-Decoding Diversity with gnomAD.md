<p>The interpretation of rare genetic variations remains one of the central
challenges in human genomics. Any two individuals differ by roughly three
and five million positions across their 3 billion–base pair genomes. Pinpointing
which of these differences in a disease-bearing individual are functionally
or clinically relevant remains a formidable challenge and requires nuanced
interpretation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks to latest advances in technology to crunch through data troves,
population-scale genome sequencing offers a path forward, providing the
necessary context critical for rare disease gene discovery and the broader
effort, e.g.&nbsp;variant classification to understand genetic contributors
of human disease.</p>
<h4><strong>Genetic Variation – the clues within</strong></h4>
<p>“There’s just no capacity for any geneticist to interpret all the variants
one by one,” said Professor Heidi Rehm, Chief Genomics Officer at Massachusetts
General Hospital and Chief Medical Officer of Broad Clinical Labs.</p>
<p>To narrow down the search for causative variants, the first step is to
eliminate common genetic variations. If a variant is prevalent in the general
populations at a rate higher than the disease prevalence, it is unlikely
to be the cause.</p>
<p>“The more populations we study, the more variants that are unlikely disease-causing
can be ruled out, thus allowing for a clinical lab or the research team
to focus on a much smaller set of variants,” said Prof Rehm, who is also
a principal investigator on major initiatives such as the <a href="https://clinicalgenome.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Clinical Genome Resource</a> and
the <a href="https://allofus.nih.gov/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">All of Us</a> research
programme.</p>
<p>Conversely, if a variant is found in a DNA (genomic) region that generally
exhibits little variation across diverse populations, it is more likely
to be associated with disease. This principle is the driving force behind
the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD), a resource that collates genetic
data from global populations. By providing large-scale allele frequency
estimates across a large spectrum of diverse populations and ancestries,
gnomAD is a resource for researchers and clinicians to assess variant rarity,
refine disease gene discovery and improve the clinical interpretation of
genetic data across a wide range of applications.</p>
<p>While the majority of gnomAD data has been aggregated into a centralised
repository from a handful of large-scale genetic diversity initiatives
and publicly available legacy datasets , emerging national genomic initiatives
offer a unique opportunity to broaden population representation, especially
for underrepresented groups.</p>
<p>However, this data centralisation approach is not feasible for all datasets,
as certain datasets must remain within their local environments due to
security, policy or legal constraints. To address this, the federated gnomAD
project was set up to incorporate these datasets, after individual-level
data is aggregated. Participating sites are guided to process their data
in a decentralised way where individual-level data remains at the source,
yet the aggregate results are combined into a single user interface and
downloadable for use by the community. Hence, a federated approach enables
secure, decentralised analysis where data remains at the source, ensuring
greater population diversity representation, data security, privacy and
scalability.</p>
<h4><strong>Singapore’s Unique Contribution—and Opportunity</strong></h4>
<p>As a leading scientific and innovation hub in Asia, Singapore’s participation
in the federated gnomAD project provides added boost to enrich the diversity
of genomic data on a global scale and promotes the nation’s visibility
on the international stage among the genomics and precision medicine community.</p>
<p>Singapore’s multi-ethnic population —comprising Chinese, Indian, and Malay
communities— positions it a uniquely valuable contributor to federated
gnomAD. These groups together represent at least 80% of the genetic variation
found across Asia, a region home to more than 4.8 billion people, making
Singapore a critical node in efforts to build more inclusive and representative
genomic reference resources.</p>
<p>The rich data resource from Singapore enhances the breadth of Asian genomic
data but also ensure that Southeast Asian populations are represented in
global precision medicine initiatives, thus complementing existing global
datasets, which are predominantly of European ancestry.</p>
<p>Meet two local researchers in Singapore, Dr Nicolas Bertin and Dr Maxime
Hebrard who are part of the federated gnomAD network.</p>
<p>“What is unique is that we have a sizeable Malay population, which is
not well-studied, and markedly underrepresented in global datasets,” said
Dr Nicolas Bertin, Group Leader of the Genome Research Informatics and
Data Science Platform (GRIDS) at the Genome Institute of Singapore (GIS),
Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR). “Including these
rare populations adds tremendous value to the database itself but also
benefits the global research and clinical communities.” Greater ancestral
diversity enhances the resolution of variant interpretation worldwide,
enabling more accurate clinical diagnosis and equitable genomic research
across populations.</p>
<p>At the same time, Singaporeans also gain from being able to compare their
genetic variations with those from individuals of similar ethnic backgrounds
in the global gnomAD dataset. “There are about five million people in Singapore,
and we have the DNA (whole genome) sequences of 100,000 individuals through
the PRECISE-SG100K study,” Dr Bertin explained. “However, globally, there
are far more individuals of Chinese or Indian descent, which will provide
much greater depth to the data than would be possible with Singapore’s
data alone. This translates into more precise allele frequency estimates
and deeper insights into rare variants in our populations.”</p>
<p>The allele frequency estimates enable researchers and clinicians to utilise
these insights to improve genetic analysis of the Asian population and
improve the management of patients with rare genetic conditions. For example,
in the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-34116-9" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SG10K_Health study, Singaporean Chinese, Malay and Indian individuals were found to have a high prevalence of familial hypercholesterolemia and hereditary breast and ovarian cancer-associated variants at 1 in 140 and 1 in 150 respectively</a>.</p>
<h4><strong>Data Federation: Maintaining the highest standards of data integrity and privacy</strong></h4>
<p>Traditionally, researchers had to centralise sensitive data in a single
repository, often facing logistical, ethical and cross-jurisdiction legal
hurdles. Federation sidesteps these barriers by allowing data to remain
securely within national boundaries while still enabling collaborative
analyses, paving the way for broader global participation in genomic research.</p>
<p>While sharing genetic data provides substantial scientific and medical
benefits, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-020-0651-0" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">it needs to be conducted in a way that safeguards privacy</a>.
“There is a lot of sensitivity about sharing genetic data or health information,
which is necessary,” said Dr Bertin. “Consolidating genetic information
by shared ancestry and geography provides extremely useful information
to the scientific community all the while providing privacy-preserving
data anonymisation guardrails. Each person’s data is anonymised as one
of hundreds or thousands of datapoints and there is no way to re-identify
an individual,” Dr Bertin said. Establishing federated access to such datasets
lays the foundation for future integrations of more granular health information,
where robust privacy-preserving safeguards are under development.”</p>
<h4><strong>Harmonising data standards and expanding to reach more groups </strong></h4>
<p>“The idea of establishing the federated gnomAD project is that the gnomAD
team shares the method of analysing the data so that each group can analyse
its dataset in its own country, under its own legislation,” explained Dr
Maxime Hebrard, Associate Researcher at GIS GRIDS, A*STAR. “Hence, each
group can benefit from the gnomAD team experience and ensure uniformity
in processing of the data that is aggregated and shared.”</p>
<p>All participating sites, including Singapore, adhere to federated gnomAD’s
best practices for data processing and quality control. Maintaining a standardised
approach to data analysis is crucial for ensuring both the accuracy of
the results and the compatibility of information shared across gnomAD nodes’
federation. The joint-call method used across the federated gnomAD project
participating research groups ensures that each dataset is processed using
the same variant-calling algorithm, resulting in consistent and high-quality
data.</p>
<p>However, as the gnomAD initiative expands to include more research groups
worldwide, and as variant-calling algorithms continue to evolve, maintaining
standardisation will become more challenging. “Furthermore, as datasets
grow larger, the cost of reprocessing all the data becomes prohibitive,”
noted Prof Rehm, who also serves as the Co-Director of gnomAD.</p>
<p>“About 85% of the genome can be called relatively accurately,” noted Prof
Rehm. “If we separately focus on the remaining 15% and potentially reprocess
just those regions, this may allow us to improve the quality of these more
challenging regions without incurring the cost of reprocessing the entire
genome.” Following this line of thinking, researchers can explore artificial
intelligence-based algorithms that identify genomic regions which can be
consistently analysed, regardless of the specific variant-calling algorithm
used.</p>
<h4><strong>A New Value Equation and its impact on population health</strong></h4>
<p>As the cost of genome sequencing becomes more accessible, the cost-benefit
equation is shifting. “There are now circumstances where the value of that
data is high enough that sequencing could perhaps one day be free to the
individual or even free to the healthcare system,” Prof Rehm said. “Other
places are also generating large datasets because the value of the genomic
and associated health data can often offset the cost of DNA sequencing.”</p>
<p>Beyond research, this shift has profound implications for healthcare.
“This is more than just a scientific exercise; this enables preventive
medicine —identifying genetic risk factors early to guide timely interventions
and reduce disease burden,” said Dr Bertin. “This does not only benefits
patients but also the healthcare system —whether public, private, or a
mix of both— by providing more cost-effectiveness and improving long-term
patient outcomes overall.”</p>
<p>Ultimately, gnomAD demonstrates that while each person’s genetic data
may seem like a small piece of the puzzle, when combined with millions
of others, it becomes a powerful tool that benefits individuals and populations
worldwide. “With the development of the federated gnomAD project, we can
take advantage of the population data from every corner of the earth. Not
only does this enhance the process of interpreting variants for us as clinical
geneticists, but more importantly, it contributes to a global scientific
effort,” Prof Rehm concluded.</p>
