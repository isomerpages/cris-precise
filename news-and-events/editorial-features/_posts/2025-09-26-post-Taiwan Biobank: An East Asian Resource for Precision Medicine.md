<p>Central to Taiwan’s strategy of promoting precision health is the Taiwan
Biobank, an ongoing cohort study to investigate lifestyle, environmental
and genetic risk factors unique to the Taiwanese population; as well as
to facilitate the discovery of prevention and treatment strategies for
both common and complex diseases.</p>
<p>The biobank has its roots in the Taiwanese government’s plan to turn Taiwan
into an “island of biomedical technology” in 2005, where it was envisioned
as a repository of large-scale biomedical and genomic data from the Taiwanese
population.<a href="https://www.ios.sinica.edu.tw/people/personal/yytsai/Tsai-Lee._2020._AnImaginedFutureCommunity.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><sup>[1]</sup></a> The
Taiwan Biobank was launched in 2012 with the target of recruiting 200,000
Taiwanese adults aged 20 to 70.</p>
<p>Data such as physical measurements and biosamples such as blood and urine
samples were collected at recruitment, with participants answering a comprehensive
questionnaire covering aspects such as lifestyle and family history. Over
30 recruitment sites were established, ensuring representation across Taiwan’s
cities and counties. As of April 2025, approximately 203,000 participants
have been recruited.<a href="https://www.twbiobank.org.tw" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><sup>[2]</sup></a>
</p>
<h4><strong>Investigating an East Asian Population</strong></h4>
<p>Taiwan is considered relatively homogenous with a predominantly Han Chinese
population, where the culture is a blend of local traditions with western
influences. The questionnaire administered to biobank participants included
a unique set of questions special to Taiwan, such as chronic exposure to
incense (e.g. mosquito coils or joss sticks used in religious rituals)
and betel nut chewing (a cultural practice). Researchers noted the potential
influence of social determinant of health, with one such study identifying
incense exposure to be a risk factor for cognitive decline.<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34913383/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><sup>[3]</sup></a>
</p>
<p>Starting from 2016, the biobank has also initiated the follow-up process
to capture changes in participants’ measurements and health status. Participants
also underwent additional scans such as electrocardiogram and ultrasound,
enriching the data collected for the research study.</p>
<h4><strong>Facilitating Efficiency in Research</strong></h4>
<p>Similar to many Nordic countries, Taiwan also offers universal healthcare
coverage in the form of the National Health Insurance (NHI). The NHI covers
almost 100% of the Taiwanese population, with the system streamlining comprehensive
electronic health record, medical claim and health insurance data.</p>
<p>Researchers in Taiwan have the option of linking biobank data with the
NHI database, along with national registries such as those for cancer and
cause of death. One researcher who has tapped on this data is Dr Lin Yen-Feng,
Associate Investigator Attending Physician, Center for Neuropsychiatric
Research, National Health Research Institutes (NHRI), Taiwan.</p>
<p>Dr Lin, whose research interests include precision psychiatry and genetic
epidemiology said, “One of my research projects focuses on identifying
why patients respond differently to antidepressants. Although clinical
studies can collect more detailed data, they are often limited by smaller
sample sizes. If biobank data can be linked with medical information, it
would enable large-scale investigations of the relationship between genetic
factors and real-world treatment outcomes.” By linking Taiwan Biobank data
with the NHI database, Dr Lin and his team were able to effectively zoom
in on a cohort that had been diagnosed with depression, and review significant
trends such as medication history, to speed up and ramp-up the research
process.</p>
<p>He said, “Continuous breakthroughs in genotyping and sequencing technologies,
along with improvement in data analysis techniques, are offering exciting
opportunities to answer questions about psychiatric diseases that, until
now, we could only guess at. But uncovering the truth requires good and
accurate data, which patients may not always be able to provide due to
social stigma or difficulty recalling details. Having access to unbiased
data records helps remove a layer of uncertainty and supports our efforts
to better understand psychiatric disorders.”</p>
<h4><strong>Enabling Future Precision Medicine</strong></h4>
<p>As of 2024, Taiwan Biobank data has been used in over 280 research projects
and 300 publications, mostly by domestic researchers. Dr Lin said, “Existing
polygenic risk scores—which estimate an individual’s genetic liability
to disease—are typically developed from European datasets, and often do
not translate well to non-European populations. In contrast, the Taiwan
Biobank is uniquely designed to capture not only the health and genetic
data of our population, but also environmental factors that may contribute
to our polygenic risks. This makes it a valuable resource for researchers
in Taiwan working to better understand genetic influences on disease within
our population.”</p>
<p>Work is also currently underway to establish a trusted research environment
to enable international researchers to access biobank data, with the service
targeted for launch in 2025. This is timely, as with its predominantly
Han Chinese participant pool, the Taiwan Biobank serves as a valuable resource
of East Asian genomes for the global research community. Despite making
up approximately 20% of the world population<a href="https://worldpopulationreview.com/continents/eastern-asia" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><sup>[5]</sup></a>,
only 4.9% of genome-wide association study (GWAS) analyses were performed
on East Asian genomes as of 2022.<a href="https://academic.oup.com/hmg/article/32/3/520/6747418" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><sup>[6]</sup></a>
</p>
<p>As Dr Lin explained, “Access to a broader range of data—including that
from the Taiwan Biobank—will not only increase the accuracy of our research,
but also advance our collective understanding of genetic influences in
diverse populations. These insights are essential to realising our aspirations
for precision medicine.”
