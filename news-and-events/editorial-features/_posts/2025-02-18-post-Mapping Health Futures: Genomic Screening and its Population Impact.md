<p>Genomic screening in newborns offers invaluable opportunities to diagnose
and treat diseases, potentially saving lives; in reproductive carriers,
there is promise to transform population health through risk identification
and prevent the transmission of genetic conditions. However, despite its
upsides, ethical concerns impede the widespread implementation of genomic
screening globally.</p>
<p>At the PRECISE-IHCC Conference, jointly organised by Precision Health
Research, Singapore (PRECISE) and the International Health Cohorts Consortium
(IHCC), speakers discussed advancements and ethical considerations in genomic
screening. Dr Chien Yin Hsiu, Director of Newborn Screening, National Taiwan
University Hospital, and Professor Martin Delatycki, Co-Director of Bruce
Lefroy Centre, Murdoch Children’s Research Institute, highlighted opportunities
offered by newborn and reproductive carrier genomic screening. Meanwhile
Professor Thong Meow Keong, Clinical Geneticist Consultant, Genetic Medicine
Unit, University of Malaya Medical Centre addressed the ethical challenges
involved in implementing these screenings.</p>
<h4><strong>Safeguarding Newborn Health through Genomic Screening</strong></h4>
<p>Dr Chien Yin Hsiu began with an overview of the current newborn screening
landscape in Taiwan. She outlined the progress made since the programme’s
introduction in 1984—both in the range of diseases screened and the number
of newborns included. These developments have significantly reduced the
lead time from testing to follow-up, diagnosis, and treatment.</p>
<p>Explaining the significance of this evolution, Dr Chien said, “Newborn
screening is a vital public health tool for early detection and intervention
of inherited genetic conditions. For instance, our study shows that the
prognosis for patients with citrin deficiency improves significantly when
identified early through newborn screening, rather than waiting for symptoms
to appear in infants. And citrin deficiency is just one of over 50 conditions
we screen for today. That is why we are strongly motivated to improve newborn
screening continually.”</p>
<p>Notably, technology has played a critical role in early detection. Innovations
such as next generation sequencing (NGS) provide more accurate and conclusive
findings to facilitate timely intervention. By demonstrating how a single
test is capable of screening for multiple diseases simultaneously, Dr Chien
highlighted how these technologies not only simplify testing but also indirectly
empower more comprehensive and personalised care.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the advancements of these technologies, she emphasised
the need for caution, especially when testing for diseases with non-specific
genetic biomarkers, or interpreting pathogenic variants. Dr Chien summarised,
“Even as we adopt advanced screening technologies like NGS to enhance test
performance, we should concurrently work together to expand our knowledge
of variants to support more robust interpretations, as well as grow our
genetic counselling capabilities to better support affected families.”</p>
<h4><strong>Protecting Future Generations with Reproductive Carrier Screening</strong></h4>
<p>Building on Dr Chien’s sharing, Prof Delatycki outlined Australia’s corresponding
journey in reproductive carrier screening, noting a similar growth trajectory
in disease and population coverage over the years. He observed that the
current state of NGS technology allows reproductive carrier screening to
be performed on over 1,000 genes for most known autosomal and X-linked
recessive genes, except for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and fragile X
syndrome (FRAX) which require standalone tests.</p>
<p>In Australia, carrier screening for cystic fibrosis, spinal muscular atrophy
and fragile X syndrome as well as haemoglobinopathies is funded by the
government while expanded carrier screening is payable by patients.</p>
<p>Increasing demand for accessible carrier screening eventually led to the
launch of the <a href="https://www.mackenziesmission.org.au/outcomes/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Mackenzie’s Mission research study</a> in
2018. The three-year study, which concluded in 2022, screened a panel of
1,281 genes and standardised reporting for pathogenic or likely pathogenic
variants and variant combinations that are expected to have a severe childhood
onset presentation and/or where early intervention is shown to improve
prognosis.</p>
<p>Presenting the findings of Mackenzie’s Mission, Prof Delatycki pointed
out that over 82.8% of couples who took part in the screening and discovered
an increased risk of genetic diseases made active decisions to avoid passing
their condition to the next generation. They did so with Preimplantation
Genetic Test for Monogenetic (PGT-M), Prenatal Diagnosis (PND) or choosing
not to conceive children.</p>
<p>More significantly, findings from Mackenzie’s Mission suggest that the
community shows a high level of acceptance towards expanded carrier screening—and
that this model of carrier screening is clinically impactful and effective.
Prof Delatycki concluded, “The data from Mackenzie’s Mission speaks for
itself. Not only does the community generally find carrier screening acceptable,
many would take it up if it were freely available. Furthermore, an organised
national screening programme—akin to the bowel cancer screening programme—is
highly cost effective.”</p>
<h4><strong>Ensuring Ethical Implementation and Practice in Genomic Screening</strong></h4>
<p>The science of genomic screening is rapidly advancing. However, comparatively
less progress has been made in areas such as accessibility, equality, ethical
approaches, and governance. Referencing current developments in genomic
medicine and the prevailing understanding of medical ethics, Prof Thong
emphasised the urgency of addressing gaps between them to ensure that the
perceived benefits of genomic screening can be fully realised.</p>
<p>Using case examples of a one-year-old boy diagnosed with beta thalassaemia
major, a two-year-old child with two gene variants of uncertain significance,
and siblings with citrin deficiency, Prof Thong effectively demonstrated
that while genomic medicine offers opportunities for intervention, varying
clinical practices and standards can impede treatments—particularly in
developing countries, where availability and affordability are unevenly
distributed. Through the examples, he also raised the seldom-discussed
issue of assent in genetic testing for minors.</p>
<p>Prof Thong advocated, “We are in an era where genomic medicine can shorten
the diagnostic odyssey for rare diseases, offer new therapies, and devise
preventive strategies for better health outcomes. To fully capture these
gains, let’s collaborate at the public policy level to standardise ethical
approaches by establishing evidence-based guidelines and policies that
can be consistently adopted across all laboratories. In clinical settings,
more healthcare practitioners must embrace the practice of genomic medicine.
This may involve redistributing some of this work across healthcare systems
so that genetics-trained specialists can better focus their efforts on
complex cases.”</p>
<p>This is the second of a three-part PRECISE-IHCC Conference series. Themed
“From Cohorts to Clinics: The New Landscape of Global Healthcare”, the
Conference held from 21 to 23 August 2024 in Singapore covered 17 topics
in precision medicine and sought to address challenges and opportunities
in translating advances into tangible enhancements in patient care to reshape
the landscape of modern healthcare.</p>
