<p><em>The inking of the memorandum of understanding (MOU) between Precision Health Research, Singapore (PRECISE) and Diagnostics Development Hub (DxD Hub) on 26 February 2024 ushers the beginning of an exciting new phase in Singapore’s National Precision Medicine (NPM) journey.</em>
</p>
<p>With the formalisation of the strategic partnership, researchers can now
not only utilise datasets from the NPM programme for research and discovery,
but also catalyse their translational research efforts and productise their
discoveries by leveraging the expertise of DxD Hub.</p>

<p>“Three goals underpin the NPM programme that PRECISE is coordinating.
They are—Research, Innovation and Enterprise. With the MOU we are signing
with DxD Hub today, we aim to catalyse this ambition by creating opportunities
that enable us to accelerate progress from genomic data insights to diagnostic
products. In addition, we hope this partnership will enable the local healthcare
ecosystem to parlay into the development of therapeutics for genomic medicine,”
said Professor Patrick Tan, Executive Director, PRECISE, at the MOU signing
ceremony.</p>
<p>Ms Irene Cheong, Acting Chief Executive Officer, DxD Hub, echoed similar
sentiments. She said, “One of our foci at DxD Hub is diseases more prevalent
in Asia, especially in Singapore. We recognise the value of leveraging
our understanding of Asian biology and phenotypes to bring innovations
and diagnostics for sometimes&nbsp;overlooked&nbsp;Asian-centric diseases
to the marketplace. With the MOU, we look forward to working even more
closely with PRECISE and its network of researchers and clinicians to unlock
more of such valuable opportunities.”</p>
<h4><strong>Improving Clinical Outcomes with NPM Data Insights</strong></h4>
<p>The first of the three-phase NPM roadmap was completed in 2021. The Phase
I findings (from the <a href="https://www.npm.sg/news-and-events/editorial-features/sg10k-discoveries-from-mapping-10000-genomes/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>SG10K_Health</u></a> study)
established a Singaporean reference database containing 10,000 genomes.
It revealed important knowledge regarding genetic variations in disease
risk and drug reactions among different ethnicities. Researchers and clinicians
can use the reference database to improve genetic analysis of Asian population
and management of patients with genetic conditions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dr Saumya Shekhar Jamuar, Director, SingHealth Duke-NUS Institute of Precision
Medicine (PRISM) and Senior Consultant, Genetics Service, KK Women’s and
Children’s Hospital (KKH) shared, “SG10K_Health has proven to be a very
useful resource when it comes to diagnosing rare diseases. Before SG10K_Health,
one of the biggest challenges we faced was that we only had reference genomic
data from mostly non-Asians. It was therefore hard to ascertain if a particular
variant is rare in the general population or rare in the population unique
to this patient’s demographic? But with the dataset and insights that PRECISE
has generated through the NPM programme, we can now make meaningful comparisons
—and more confidently interpret genetic variants of concern.”</p>

</p>
<p>Inspired by the sharing, Mr Jason Ng, Legal Lead from ClavystBio, said,
“It is heartening to see how different parts of the ecosystem are rallying
behind PRECISE to translate data into insights—and push for groundbreaking
innovation. This goes to show that the work that PRECISE is doing is very
important. We are aligned in that vision—and are excited to contribute
towards its realisation.”</p>
<h4><strong>Leveraging NPM Datasets as an Enabler for Innovation</strong></h4>
<p>Notably, the use of these data insights is not limited to translational
research. The rich data output from the NPM programme also has the potential
to be converted into novel diagnostic assays and instrument platforms like
a customised genetic test panel that screen for carriers of common severe
recessive diseases among Singaporeans. The panel&nbsp; recently developed
by Dr Jamuar and his colleagues at KKH and PRISM in partnership with DxD
Hub was facilitated by PRECISE.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Prof Patrick Tan, Executive Director, PRECISE</em>
</p>
<p>Prof Patrick Tan said, “This is a compelling use case of NPM’s journey
from bench to bedside—and PRECISE is privileged to facilitate the creation
of this customised genetic test panel. Such is the value of PRECISE. We
facilitate access to data through our research partners, bring people together
and subsequently step back so that you do what you are good at. In this
instance, through bringing together Dr Jamuar’s team at PRISM and KKH,
and DxD Hub, we empowered the translation of insights from a paper into
a product that can be commercialised and industrialised to benefit the
Singapore population. We also hope to positively impact diverse communities
globally, particularly Asians, as commercial panels have been mostly designed
for Caucasian populations. After the MOU today, we look forward to facilitating
more of such partnerships.”</p>

</p>
<p>Expressing her excitement about the news, Dr Zhao Pan, Vice President,
Genomics, MiRXES, said, “I am so glad to see such enthusiasm from fellow
industry players, researchers and clinicians. We look forward to developing
Asian specific genetic tests through the NPM dataset and the MOU.”&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Realising Opportunities to Transform Global Healthcare</strong></h4>
<p>The NPM Phase II that was launched in 2021 is ongoing. In December 2022,
the PRECISE-SG100K study was launched as part of NPM Phase II. When completed,
the study will provide detailed characterisation of 100,000 Singaporeans—enabling
the identification of social, environmental, lifestyle and genetic factors
associated with diseases prevalent in Singapore and the Asian region for
the first time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To positively and sustainably impact clinical outcomes at scale however,
it is crucial for corporations and industry players with expert productisation
manufacturing know-how to be engaged. They are essential for translating
findings into efficacious medicines and products that can be used safely
in humans, and manufacture and distribute these products to hospitals and
communities. Their abilities to convert rich data output from the NPM into
novel diagnostic assays and instrument platforms is also necessary to bolster
the aspiration of precision medicine in disease prevention.</p>
<p>“My company is into precision oncology. Given the increasing prevalence
of cancer disease in the ageing Singapore population and rising costs of
cancer drugs and treatments, we see a great opportunity to leverage the
MOU and data insights from the NPM programme to strengthen our offerings
and its accessibility to the market—helping more people in the process,”
said Ms Sivanissawary Manoharan, Research Assistant, LifeStrands Genomics.</p>
<p>“We are on track to complete NPM Phase II by early 2025. Together, I am
confident that the PRECISE-SG100K population cohort study will advance
the understanding of our researchers and clinicians on diseases and health
conditions for both Singaporeans and the wider Asian population. More significantly,
we hope the data generated from our NPM journey can catalyse and enable
innovation and enterprise across diverse emerging and adjacent industries
along the health and wellness value chain to tangibly benefit patients
and communities alike,” Prof Patrick Tan rounded up.</p>
