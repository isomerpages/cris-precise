<p>Any two human beings are 99.9% identical—and the genetic differences between
different populations are similarly minute. Yet, the 0.1% difference harbours
significant gene-encoded protein diversity and expression differences,
contributing to varying susceptibility to diseases and resistance to medications
and has significant implications for research, healthcare and society.
<a href="#_ftn1" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">[1]</a>This makes understanding the rich tapestry of genomic diversity
across populations essential, for advancing precision medicine and developing
more effective, tailored treatments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Speakers at the PRECISE-IHCC Conference, jointly organised by Precision
Health Research, Singapore (PRECISE) and the International Health Cohorts
Consortium (IHCC) last August, highlighted various international and national
initiatives undertaken by groups and countries to unlock genomic diversity
across populations.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Driving the World’s Largest Neuroimaging Genetics Initiative</strong></h4>
<p>One standout initiative was the ENIGMA Consortium and its scale. Engaging
over 2,500 imaging genomics researchers across 47 countries, Professor
Paul Thompson, Director of the ENIGMA Center for Worldwide Medicine, University
of Southern California, explained the Consortium’s mission to uncover insights
from brain imaging and genetic data to understand how the brain changes
over one’s lifetime, and how diseases, treatments, and genes affect brain
structure and function.</p>
<p>He shared that ENIGMA is leveraging neuroimages worldwide to answer important
questions that have plagued us for a long time. For instance, are some
brains more resilient to detrimental effects because of their genetics—and
if so, can studying them lead us to potential new medications? These are
the areas the working groups in development and ageing, genomics with a
focus on evolution and gene-environment interactions, and neuroimaging
and therapeutic interventions are looking to explore.</p>
<p>Since its founding in 2009, ENIGMA has grown to comprise over 50 working
groups. With over 30 of them organised around brain diseases, it is evident
that ENIGMA is not only looking to unlock the secrets of healthy brains,
but also to gain a deeper understanding of brain diseases, including Alzheimer’s
disease, Parkinson’s, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, Tourette’s syndrome
and autism. “Through neuroimaging, we can see how the brains of people
with Alzheimer’s disease and depression are different from healthy people.
Or which brain regions’ developments are disrupted in children with autism,”
Professor Thompson elaborated.</p>
<h4><strong>Exploring Diversity in a Seemingly Homogenous Population</strong></h4>
<p>Over the years, the scale and inclusivity of its datasets spanning diverse
populations and geographical areas—both rural and urban—have enabled the
ENIGMA Consortium to make significant discoveries about specific genetic,
and environmental features or neurobiological markers associated with brain
disorder risk and treatment outcome. However, these achievements are not
without challenges.</p>
<p>For example, the need to coordinate and create standardised metrics for
accessing clinical symptoms of patients across multiple research sites
is one that particularly resonated with Associate Professor Biju Viswanath
from the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS).
Also a key investigator at the Rohini Nilekani Centre for Brain and Mind
at NIMHANS, A/Prof Viswanath led coordination efforts across multiple clinical
sites in a consortium comprising 48 psychiatrists and a multidisciplinary
team across the country.</p>
<p>Recognising that one in seven Indians is affected by a mental disorder—and
that each affected individual lives with the condition for an average of
15 years with disability<a href="#_ftn2" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">[2]</a>, A/Prof Viswanath and his research collaborators
embarked on a longitudinal study to better understand the burden of mental
disorders across Indian states. Working with 20,000 genomic samples, A/Prof
Viswanath and team explored how genetics, environment and social stigma
intersect to shape mental health outcomes.</p>
<p>While the strong stigma associated with mental disorders impeded the progress
of recruitment and receptivity to the study in the beginning, the team’s
perseverance and methodical approach eventually led to groundbreaking findings.
In a largely homogeneous population with perceivably little ancestral diversity,
the researchers were able to demonstrate the role of genetic predisposition
in families with mental disorders, the impact of adverse childhood experiences
on the onset of psychiatric illnesses, and identify genes and/or proteins
that could cause atypical disease presentation or resistance to standard
treatments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reflecting on the significance of these insights, A/Prof Viswanath said,
“We have a good momentum going at the moment. This is the first time a
targeted study of this scale has been conducted for the South Asian population—and
as we’ve come to realise, there’s actually so much diversity within India.
Some specific clusters are emerging from our analyses. These findings are
really exciting both from a research perspective and in shaping policies
for more effective interventions.”</p>
<p>As a next step, A/Prof Viswanath’s team is looking not only to expand
their datasets and build on their analyses, but also explore the portability
of their findings to other parts of the world, including Europe and the
Americas.</p>
<h4><strong>Uncovering the Role of Genetic Ancestry in Shaping Precision Medicine</strong></h4>
<p>Complementary to the work carried out by ENIGMA and A/Prof Viswanath’s
work in mental health in India which revealed unexpected layers of diversity,
similar revelations are emerging from Latin America. Professor Andrés Moreno-Estrada,
Head of Genomic Services, Cinvestav-Mexico shared insights into the Mexican
Biobank project—which he is leading.</p>
<p>In Mexico, a nationwide effort is underway to map the genotypes of over
6,000 Mexicans. Conducted across all 32 states of Mexico in both rural
and urban areas from 898 local sites, the collected data is representative
of the nationwide diversity. Touching on the significance of this effort,
Prof Estrada said, “Latin America is a highly differentiated region—so
we are not just different from other regions but also diverse within the
region. With the Mexican Biobank project, we aim to not just step up on
our genetic representation globally, but also gain deeper insights into
the genetic characterisation within the region. For example, by tracing
the genetic evolution of populations across different geographies, we can
recover and reconstruct the historical trajectories of previous civilisations
and their development over time.”</p>
<p>He emphasised that this knowledge can help to identify genetic predispositions
in their population that stem from indigenous ancestry—insights that could
ultimately help inform and address some of the current challenges in Mexico’s
public health system.”</p>
<p>However, Prof Estrada concurred that these gains can only be sustained
through successful recruitment of participants in both rural and urban
communities—which calls for capacity building and resource sharing among
researchers and institutions when it comes to data and knowledge. He rounded
up, “Governments, organisations and populations from different parts of
the world are warming up to the idea of precision medicine—but for it to
truly realise its full potential, we need to work together, learn all we
can about what sets us apart from one another, and create opportunities
for populations to become healthier.”</p>
<p>A common theme emerges across these initiatives—despite their varied geographies,
scopes and foci: meaningful precision medicine must be rooted in diverse
data, shared resources and inclusive collaboration.</p>
<p>This is the last of a three-part PRECISE-IHCC conference series. Themed
“From Cohorts to Clinics: The New Landscape of Global Healthcare”, the
conference held from 21 to 23 August 2024 in Singapore covered 17 topics
in precision medicine and sought to address challenges and opportunities
in translating advances into tangible enhancements in patient care to reshape
the landscape of modern healthcare.</p>
