<p>As countries across Asia undergo rapid economic development, the region
is also experiencing a profound shift in disease burden—from infectious
illnesses to chronic, non-communicable diseases. Chief among them is cardiovascular
disease, now the leading cause of death and disability in Asia.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Another important shift is that it is now happening in younger age groups,”
said Associate Professor Rinkoo Dalan, a clinician-scientist at the Nanyang
Technological University (NTU) Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine and senior
consultant in endocrinology at Tan Tock Seng Hospital. Despite the scale
of the problem, large-scale longitudinal studies of cardiovascular risk
in Asian populations are few and far between.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Asians have unique genetic, dietary and lifestyle factors, so we can’t
always generalise from studies done in Western populations,” Assoc Prof
Dalan explained. Asian-specific research not only validates Western findings
but can uncover new, population-specific insights, she continued.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Searching for Metabolic Signals</strong>&nbsp;</h4>
<p></p>
<p>To address this knowledge gap about the unique features of cardiovascular
disease in Asians, researchers led by Dr Nilanjana Sadhu at NTU turned
to metabolomics and cardiovascular imaging. Their study, recently published
in <em><a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s44161-025-00638-w" class="Hyperlink SCXW215994406 BCX8" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><u>Nature Cardiovascular Research</u></a></em>,
examined the relationship between blood metabolites and a well-established
marker of atherosclerosis: carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT). Measured
via ultrasound, cIMT reflects the thickness of the artery walls in the
neck and serves as an indicator of subclinical atherosclerosis. “For every
0.1 millimeter increase in cIMT over the normal range, the risk of heart
attack increases by about 10 to 15 percent, and the risk of stroke increases
by 13 to 18 percent,” Assoc Prof Dalan said. &nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Unlike other methods of screening for the narrowing of arteries associated
with heart disease, cIMT does not involve radiation, and its non-invasive
nature makes it a practical screening tool for large-scale studies like
the <a href="https://www.healthforlife.sg/" class="Hyperlink SCXW215994406 BCX8" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"><u>Health for Life in Singapore (HELIOS)</u></a> cohort,
part of the national SG100K precision medicine initiative. Meanwhile, metabolites—small
molecules that are byproducts of metabolic processes—offer a window into
the biochemical activity occurring in the body. Using untargeted mass spectrometry,
the team quantified nearly 900 metabolites in blood samples from 8,124
participants in the HELIOS cohort. Of these, 126 were found to be correlated
with cIMT.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>“However, correlation does not imply causation,” Dr Sadhu cautions. To
determine whether any of these metabolites directly influenced cardiovascular
risk, the researchers used a method known as Mendelian randomisation (MR).
MR leverages genetic variants as proxies for an exposure—in this case,
metabolite levels—thus mimicking a randomized controlled trial. For MR
to be valid, the genetic variant must satisfy three criteria: it must be
associated with the exposure, not be confounded by other variables, and
influence the outcome only through the exposure.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>After extensive sensitivity analyses, one molecule stood out: 3beta-hydroxy-5-cholestenoate
(3BH5C), a cholesterol metabolite. Higher genetically predicted levels
of 3BH5C were causally linked to reduced risk of coronary artery disease.
“It’s a robust signal, and we were able to trace a potentially causal relationship,”
Dr Sadhu said. Even more striking was the population-specific nature of
the findings. “The effect in Asians is five- to six-fold higher than it
is in Europeans,” Dr Sadhu said. Genetic variants associated with the risk
of coronary artery disease are more prevalent in Asian populations and
further underscores the importance of ethnically diverse research.”&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>From Molecule to Mechanism: The Role of <em>FDX1</em></strong>&nbsp;</h4>
<p></p>
<p>3BH5C is produced when cholesterol is metabolised by an enzyme known as
CYP27A1. When genetic variants effecting the levels of 3BH5C were mapped
to the human genome, they were found to be closely located to the gene
for a protein known as ferredoxin-1 (<em>FDX1</em>).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Using a technique called co-localisation analysis, we were able to identify
variants that change both the level of the metabolite 3BH5C in the blood
and expression of <em>FDX1,</em>” Dr Sadhu explained. “How it works is that
if there’s a genetic variant that decreases the expression of <em>FDX1</em>,
then it changes the enzymatic efficacy of CYP27A1, thus breaking down less
cholesterol, which in turn leads to lower synthesis of 3BH5C.”&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>To validate this pathway, the researchers conducted experiments in cells
known to express CYP27A1, namely hepatocytes and macrophages. When the <em>FDX1 gene</em> was
removed by gene editing, production of 3BH5C dropped sharply. Conversely,
increasing the expression of FDX1 increased 3BH5C levels and promoted the
removal of cholesterol from cells, particularly in macrophages and vascular
smooth muscle cells known to be associated with atherosclerotic plaques.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Addressing the Needs of Asian Patients</strong>&nbsp;</h4>
<p></p>
<p>These results suggest that genetic screening for specific <em>FDX1</em> gene
variants could be useful for identifying individuals at a higher risk of
developing high cholesterol and coronary artery disease, “We could pursue
more aggressive cholesterol reduction in these individuals, and use their <em>FDX1</em> status
to tailor treatments in terms of how much of a given drug to use to make
it more safe and effective,” Assoc Prof Dalan said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>The metabolite 3BH5C itself is also promising as a biomarker, Dr Sadhu
added. “The nice thing about looking at metabolites and proteins is that
they can be measured in blood samples. Therefore, if a metabolite is causally
linked through a certain pathway to a higher risk of an outcome, then you
could potentially use it directly as a biomarker for easily stratifying
or identifying high risk individuals,” she said.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>As heart disease continues to rise across Asia, cost-effective screening
and prevention strategies are essential. “With a huge population and rising
rates of chronic disease, precision medicine allows us to identify the
right patient, at the right time, for the right intervention,” said Assoc
Prof Dalan. “Such precision medicine is an urgent unmet need especially
in the realm of cardiovascular disease, which is very heterogeneous and
usually linked to multiple genes. Identifying singular genes, like we have
done in this paper, can be very powerful to help design diet and lifestyle
interventions—and eventually, therapeutics—in a precise way for patients.”&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Our research demonstrates that it is important to study Asian datasets
such as HELIOS, even for something as widely studied as cardiovascular
disease,” Dr Sadhu said. “The population-specific findings we have discovered
couldn’t have been made using any western dataset, so I’m very excited
about what else we will find in the pioneering SG100K dataset.”&nbsp;</p>
