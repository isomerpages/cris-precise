<p><em>Could the key to tackling rising mental health challenges lie in the microbiome? Researchers at GLOW are leading the charge to find out.</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Singapore’s healthcare priorities have evolved with the times—shifting
from infectious diseases like tuberculosis to chronic conditions like cardiovascular
disease and cancer. Now, attention is turning to a new frontier: mental
health. Addressing this complex issue could be the country’s most ambitious
healthcare goal to date. “This is a moonshot; it is uncharted territory
and no one yet knows what we will be able to find,” says Professor John
Chambers, Chief Scientific Officer of Singapore’s national precision health
initiative, PRECISE.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>The statistics paint a compelling picture: 1 in 7 Singaporeans would have
experienced a mental health condition such as depression over the course
of their lifetimes. Beyond the profound personal toll, the economic impact
of mental health conditions is substantial. In 2022, lost productivity
due to anxiety and depression was estimated to cost S$15.7 billion, nearly
3% of Singapore’s GDP; highlighting the urgent need for innovative approaches
to understand, prevent, and treat mental health conditions.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>While dedicated research has led to significant strides in how conditions
like cancer are treated, studying mental health presents a unique set of
challenges. The predominant research tools—cell lines and animal models—just
aren’t able to capture the complexity of the human mind and behaviour.
“Are brain cells in a dish or even a mouse brain a good model of the human
brain? Particularly when it comes to behavioural responses to stress and
so on, it is much more difficult to make that leap from research to the
real world,” explains Professor Patrick Tan, Executive Director of PRECISE.
Furthermore, obtaining patient samples from the brain is often considerably
more difficult than skin or tumour tissue, he adds.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>A promising new approach: The microbiome</strong>&nbsp;</h4>
<p></p>
<p>How then can Singapore tackle the multifaceted challenge of mental health?
“One way is to study the population and look at natural genetic variation
in a sufficiently large number of people and see if specific variants affect
these sorts of conditions,” says Tan, noting that this has been the goal
of the National Precision Medicine (NPM) programme since its inception
in 2017.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>While certain mental health conditions are known to have a strong genetic
basis, genetics typically accounts for approximately 30% of susceptibility
for most diseases, says Chambers. “That means the rest of the causes are
non-genetic and there is still a lot more to be discovered. Those could
be behavioural choices, diets or patterns of physical activity, but also
exposures we encounter on a day-to-day basis—including the microbes that
live within us,” he continues.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>The microbiome is a complex ecosystem comprising trillions of bacteria,
viruses, fungi and other microorganisms that live in the body, collectively
containing far more genetic information than their human hosts. In addition
to conditions like inflammatory bowel disease and obesity, the dysregulation
of the gut microbiome has also been linked to mental health disturbances.
There are several plausible reasons for this: Firstly, the gut is directly
linked to the brain through a dense network of nerves known as the gut-brain
axis. Secondly, many gut bacteria are known to produce chemicals that can
affect the brain, such as short chain fatty acids. Finally, damage to the
gut barrier could also lead to inflammation that in turn affects brain
function.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>“So there is some evidence to suggest that different gut microbiomes might
be linked to differences in mental health or the enjoyment of life, but
it is largely based on cross-sectional studies in a small number of settings,
mostly in the northern hemisphere,” says Chambers. “There are some good
hypotheses around generation of neuroactive peptides or neuroactive chemicals,
but the evidence base is relatively weak and there’s a lot more to be discovered.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Furthermore, the microbiome is an appealing target for intervention: unlike
genetics which are largely fixed upon conception, the microbiome can be
altered—perhaps even easily and cost-effectively—offering a novel and accessible
pathway for improving mental wellbeing, he says.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>GLOW: A mental health moonshot</strong>&nbsp;</h4>
<p></p>
<p>To better understand the connection between the microbiome and mental
health, Singapore has launched a multi-institutional research initiative
called Gut-Linked Outcomes in Wellbeing or GLOW. A pioneering initiative
and largest of its kind in Asia, GLOW brings together academic institutions
such as the National University of Singapore (NUS) and the Genome Institute
of Singapore, medical institutions like Duke-NUS and the Lee Kong Chian
Medical School and hospital partners Institute of Mental Health (IMH),
Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) and NHG Polyclinics. The initiative extends
the capabilities of the first two phases of the NPM, encompassing both
human and microbial genetics.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>The study aims to involve some 6,000 participants, building a database
of each person’s microbiome and juxtaposing it with their own genetic data
as well as non-genetic information. “GLOW is substantially different from
what we have done previously as it allows us to characterise the stool
microbiome, which has not been done before at scale in Singapore,” Chambers
says.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>“It will also give us a substantial amount of information decoding each
individual’s mental state, including a more extensive range of subjective
measures about self-perceived wellness but also objective techniques, in
particular digital platforms for assessing metrics that are indicative
of mental wellbeing.” Called “digital phenotyping” these metrics include
data from wearables, such as heart rate variability and activity levels,
which could give a more comprehensive view of a person’s mental state.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the next few years, the goal is for GLOW to raise the profile of mental
health and microbiome research, building local capabilities in both fields
and establishing Singapore as a well-regarded place to conduct globally
significant research, Tan says. “We hope to catalyse interest and get a
community of people collaborating, starting with the investigators in the
programme but expanding out to the wider institutions to increase interest
in this line of research,” he shares. Looking further to the horizon, the
second goal is to get from insights to potential interventions, having
validated the functional links between the gut and the brain.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Our ultimate goal, however, is to bring the results back to Singaporean
patients,” Tan says. “For this we have to be balanced between speed and
responsibility, in terms of introducing interventions only after they have
been sufficiently validated but also deemed to be cost-effective. This
is where our partnerships with hospitals are particularly important, as
we work together to design what can be done in this space on a national
scale.”&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>The good news is that GLOW is not starting from ground zero, but builds
on a solid foundation laid during the earlier stages of the NPM programme.
“For instance, we can bring in the sequencing capabilities and data sharing
frameworks developed for NPM Phase I and II. We also have experience with
national-scale rollouts, with the launch of the familial hypercholesterolemia
screening programme,” Tan says. “So while GLOW is not exactly the same,
we can use some of the lessons learnt as a ‘pathfinder’ for the way forward.”&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>“I’m really excited not only to address mental health as an issue particularly
relevant to the next generation, but also discovering potentially groundbreaking
solutions,” Chambers adds.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
