<p><strong>Harnessing insights from the PRECISE-SG100K genome dataset to advance precision medicine in Singapore</strong>
</p>
<p>At the event, local researchers were also recognised for their project
proposals that were selected to leverage the first release dataset, generated
from fully consented cohorts, to advance scientific knowledge and enable
clinical translation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This development stemmed from an <a href="https://www.npm.sg/flagship-projects/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">“Open Call for Proposal” (CFP)</a> in
November 2023, where scientists and physicians were invited to submit their
proposals to utilise the PRECISE-SG100K data resource and to translate
these research findings into precision health care approaches.</p>
<p>A total of 36 projects were selected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eight Flagship Projects were selected based on their alignment with Singapore’s
National Precision Medicine (NPM) programme and their potential for impactful
discoveries. These projects will play a crucial role in showcasing key
research outcomes and will have the opportunity to work closely with the
PRECISE Scientific Committee and Data Science Team to discover new insights
and advance precision medicine in Singapore.</p>
<p>In addition, 28 Driver Projects were also selected for their scientific
value and well-articulated project plans. These projects will deep dive
into a diverse range of topics from chronic liver disease to in-depth studies
into the intricacies of how genetic variants or associations can affect
disease susceptibility, drug responses, metabolism, behavioural traits
and more.</p>
<p></p>

Chief Medical and Scientific Officer of the All of Us Research Program.</p>
<p>The conference will also gather leaders from prominent population cohort
study programmes worldwide, creating an intellectual nexus in Asia that
spans the Americas and European regions. This gathering will cover cohort
study programmes in China, Japan and Taiwan, emphasising the significance
of this event in drawing global expertise into the Asian context.</p>
<p>This landmark event will bring together close to 600 thought leaders,
clinicians, scientists and companies from across the globe who are at the
forefront of precision medicine and healthcare innovation and present an
excellent opportunity for collaboration, knowledge exchange, and the forging
of new pathways towards advancing precision medicine for the benefit of
patients worldwide.</p>
<p>The conference seeks to foster scientific exchange, integrate precision
science into patient care, and showcase global advancements in genomic
medicine. Key topics include the development and utilisation of biobanks
for precision medicine, advancements in cancer genetics, ethics and policy
in genomic research, and strategies for resolving complex genetic traits
and variants.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Discussions will also cover data-driven discovery and validating data
from cohorts. Attendees will explore genetic counselling, community engagement,
and the role of genomics and precision medicine in therapeutic Research
and Development.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additional focal points include genomic diversity, genomic science in
cohort studies, genomic screening, pharmacogenomics, and population health.
The event will also lend attention to research in rare diseases, efforts
in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), and opportunities for early
career scientists to present their work and engage with leading professionals.</p>
<p>Professor Patrick Tan, Executive Director, PRECISE, said “The PRECISE-IHCC
Conference is a testament to our collective dedication to transform healthcare
through precision medicine. By harnessing the power of genomic data, we
are paving the way for ground-breaking advancements in patient care. This
conference is a wonderful platform for Singapore to showcase and leverage
our unique Asian heritage to better understand precision medicine advances
and share these insights from Singapore to Asia, and to the world.”</p>
<p>Dr Michèle Ramsay, Co-chair, IHCC, said “IHCC is delighted to partner
with PRECISE to bring together an international community of population
cohorts with the unified purpose of promoting precision health for all.
Technological advances and partnerships are enabling mechanisms that fuel
novel discovery. Furthermore, data from large and diverse cohorts will
enrich our understanding of mechanistic pathway to disease and will enable
machine learning approaches to develop targeted interventions. With a focus
on cohorts from under-represented and underserved communities worldwide,
with 89 member cohorts in 42 countries, collectively including over 34
million participants, IHCC will contribute global perspectives and provide
opportunities to study the comparative utility of clinical interventions.
Together we will connect, convene, and catalyse discussions around the
