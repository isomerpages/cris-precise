<p><strong>A new national consortium – the Consortium for Clinical Research and Innovation, Singapore (CRIS) – has been officially launched by the Minister for Health Mr Ong Ye Kung on 6 April 2022</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>CRIS brings together five key national R&amp;D, clinical translation and service initiatives that will advance clinical research and innovation for Singapore, and establish important capabilities for a future-ready healthcare system</strong>

<p><strong>SINGAPORE, 6 APRIL 2022</strong>&nbsp;– Over the past decades,
Singapore has developed a world-class healthcare system, with leading clinicians
and advanced infrastructure, to deliver quality healthcare that is affordable
and sustainable.</p>
<p>In 2000, the Government launched the biomedical sciences initiative to
build the biomedical industry as the fourth pillar of the economy. This
has led to peaks of scientific excellence, robust infrastructure, a pipeline
for talent for biomedical research, and translation of discoveries into
tangible capabilities and commercial enterprises.</p>
<p>Leveraging these developments to advance healthcare capabilities and create
economic value for Singapore, the&nbsp;<strong>Consortium for Clinical Research and Innovation, Singapore (CRIS)</strong>&nbsp;has
been established to bring together five key national R&amp;D, clinical
translation and service initiatives that are under the stewardship of the
Ministry of Health.</p>
<p>These are:</p>

</p>
<p>“As Singapore’s basic science capabilities and talent base have begun
to mature, and as our research initiatives find footing to deliver impact,
it is timely to bring them under one roof. Together as CRIS, we seek to
ensure a unity of mission across our programmes, synergise our capabilities,
scientific resources and industry engagement. This way, we stay relevant
and aligned to the needs of Singapore patients, healthcare system and researchers,
and build long-term sustainability for these efforts,” said&nbsp;Dr Danny
Soon, Chief Executive Officer of CRIS and Executive Director of SCRI.</p>
<p>At the CRIS official launch ceremony held on 6 April 2022, two of CRIS’s
initiatives – ACTRIS and SCRI – announced the following partnerships:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>ACTRIS and NUS Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine has jointly launched a
professional certification course on the principles and practice of cell
therapy. This course is the first of its kind in Asia and will equip healthcare
professionals and biomedical personnel with the necessary training and
knowledge in immuno-therapeutics.&nbsp;<em>Refer to</em>&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.cris.sg/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/03-Press-Release-Annex-2-Fact-Sheet-Collaboration-between-ACTRIS-and-NUS-Yong-Loo-Lin-School-of-Medicine.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Annex 2</a></em>&nbsp;<strong><em>for more details.</em></strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SCRI will be partnering a local health-tech company Oncoshot to leverage
its technology which has the potential to significantly enhance the initiation,
screening and enrolment of patients into oncology trials conducted at public
healthcare institutions.&nbsp;<em>Refer to</em>&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.cris.sg/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/04-Press-Release-Annex-3-Fact-Sheet-MOU-between-SCRI-and-Oncoshot.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Annex 3</a></em>&nbsp;<em>for more details</em>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Moving ahead, CRIS aims to build networks and collaborations for regional
clinical trials, perform cost-effectiveness assessments for healthcare
interventions, and foster industry engagement to fulfil the CRIS Vision
– “to nurture and build cutting edge capabilities and innovation in clinical
research and translation for Singapore”.</p>
<p>CRIS Chairman, Professor John Lim said: “With Singapore pivoting to a
Healthier SG strategy, focusing on community and preventive care, CRIS
will support MOH’s and national priorities by identifying impactful health-tech
innovation through NHIC, supporting preventive health through appropriate
implementation of precision medicine at PRECISE, gleaning a good understanding
of cost-effectiveness in cancer and cell therapies at STCC and ACTRIS,
and promoting an efficient environment for relevant clinical trials through
SCRI. In this way, CRIS aims to keep Singapore at the forefront of clinical
and translational research innovation, while actively advancing the sustainability,
affordability and quality of Singapore’s healthcare system.”</p>
