<h3><strong>Beyond the Genome</strong></h3>
<p><em>Other pieces of the Precision Medicine puzzle</em>
</p>
<p>Besides your genes, what else affects your health?&nbsp;Here, we guide
you through ‘omics approaches for&nbsp;investigating disease and advancing
precision medicine.</p>
<p>Previously, we saw how your DNA can impact health and disease. As important
as it is,&nbsp;genomics alone won’t capture the full picture of all the
events happening inside your body. Indeed, understanding your DNA is just
the start; what happens next when DNA is transcribed into RNA, made into
proteins and starts acting on levels of key molecules in the body is just
as important. The study of all these different components is the work of
‘omics research.</p>

<h4><strong>Transcriptomics: All about RNA</strong></h4>
<p>The full genome has six billion DNA base pairs, but only about 80% of
that is copied into RNA, the ‘working copy’ of genetic information stored
in the genome. About 3% of that RNA is then further converted (translated)
into proteins—more on them later. The remaining 97% of the transcriptome
is called non-coding RNA. While they don’t result in proteins, non-coding
RNA nonetheless plays an important role in switching genes on and off.</p>

<h4><strong>Proteomics: Information in Action</strong></h4>
<p>With proteins as with life, timing and location are everything. The right
protein produced&nbsp;in the wrong part of the body can sometimes have
disastrous effects, including cancer.&nbsp;To orchestrate the millions
of proteins in a single cell, proteins can be modified or&nbsp;activated
by attaching and removing sugars or chemical groups known as phosphates.&nbsp;Proteomics
is the study of the when, where and how proteins are produced, modified&nbsp;and
localised, as well as how they interact with each other.</p>

<h4><strong>Metabolomics: Counting Calories, and More!</strong></h4>
<p>As patients with diabetes know, keeping the level of glucose in your blood
steady can make&nbsp;the difference between life and death. But glucose
is just one of many metabolites, small&nbsp;molecules produced and used
by your body. The metabolome—the sum total of all the&nbsp;metabolites
in a cell, tissue, organ or bodily fluid—gives a snapshot of a person’s
health&nbsp;and can be influenced by external cues like lifestyle factors,
age and ethnicity.</p>

<h4><strong>‘Omics and Precision Medicine</strong></h4>
<p>Complex diseases like cancer are rarely traced back to a single mutation,
but arise from&nbsp;multiple alterations in DNA, RNA, proteins and metabolites.
With ‘omics approaches,&nbsp;precision medicine tackles health from these
distinct yet interacting layers. This way,&nbsp;scientists target the right
components in developing effective diagnostic tools and&nbsp;treatments
against diseases.</p>
