<h4><em>While individual patients have much to gain from precision medicine, when done responsibly, it is healthcare as a whole that could potentially be transformed.</em></h4>
<hr>
<h4><strong>Benefits for Patients and Populations</strong></h4>
<p>Compare yourself with a stranger on the street and you could probably
come up a long list of what make the two of you different: your skin colour,
your height or even your personality. Although the two of you share 99.9
percent of the same DNA, the remaining 0.1 percent can clearly make a world
of a difference.</p>
<p>Yet when it comes to healthcare, individual differences are often ignored
in favour of treating the ‘average’ patient. Although doctors do take factors
such as age, sex and family history into account, most patients with the
same disease receive the same drugs, even if they may not ultimately benefit
from it. The situation is particularly dire for conditions like Alzheimer’s
disease, where&nbsp;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S1471-4914(01)01986-4" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">70 percent</a>&nbsp;of
patients do not respond to the medications available.</p>
<p>But what if doctors had more information at their disposal to make better
recommendations to their patients? This is the goal of precision medicine,
which aims to move away from a one-size-fits-all approach to provide targeted
treatments. It not only considers a patient’s genetic background, but their
lifestyle and environmental exposure as well, providing a much more holistic
understanding of each patient and how he or she might respond.</p>
<h4><strong>More Effective Drugs, Fewer Side Effects</strong></h4>
<p>Far from being a distant reality, precision medicine is actually already
being practiced today, albeit in a limited way. For example, once a patient
has been diagnosed with breast cancer, they are often offered a test to
determine whether their cancer cells have certain markers, information
that can help them identify which drugs would be the most effective for
their specific type of cancer.</p>
<p>As scientists learn more about the genetic causes of a growing list of
diseases, such tests will slowly become commonplace in the clinic, helping
doctors chart the best course of treatment for their patients upon diagnosis
instead of putting them through a trial-and-error process of figuring out
the right drugs. By comparing each your DNA against sequences in large
genetic databases, medical professionals will be more likely to find patients
like you, and tailor your treatment based on what was found to be best
for those patients.</p>
<p>Precision medicine could also be a matter of life or death for certain
patients. Because they lack an enzyme to process a common amino acid, patients
with phenylketonuria must avoid certain foods and artificial sweeteners
or risk severe brain damage and even death. Just as the screening of newborns
at birth has saved the lives of many people with phenylketonuria, precision
medicine could also identify which patients might suffer severe side effects
before the drugs are given, potentially averting disaster.</p>
<h4><strong>For the Health of the Population</strong></h4>
<p>While precision medicine holds great promise for individual patients and
their family members who may share the same genetic variants, its greatest
impact maybe at the population level instead. Not only do more effective
treatments and fewer side effects reduce the overall burden on the healthcare
system, but the ability to identify patients at risk of disease allows
doctors to focus on prevention rather than cure. This is because conditions
diagnosed when the disease is pronounced are much harder—and more costly—to
treat, with no guarantee of success.For example, while diabetes can be
managed at the early stage, patients that find out about their condition
only when the symptoms are severe could face heart disease, stroke or even
the loss of limbs.</p>
<p>Although there is the misperception that precision medicine is expensive
and only serves to drive patients to unaffordable tests and treatments,
the reverse is true. In a&nbsp;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2020.04.1829" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">recent study</a>&nbsp;of
biomarker-based screening for gastric cancer, researchers found that screening
was cost-effective for Chinese men aged 50 to 75, largely because they
are four times more likely to have gastric cancer than the general population.
In the case of other diseases, such as diabetes or heart disease, other
ethnic groups are more at risk and would benefit from screening. Thus,
whenused for those who need it the most, precision medicine can help make
good use of finite healthcare budgets.</p>
<p>In fact, responsibly and carefully considered applications of precision
medicine could mitigate Singapore’s rising healthcare expenditures in the
face of challenges like an ageing population and the attendant surge of
chronic diseases. Empowered with information about their genetic susceptibility
to disease, patients can take targeted prevention and health promotion
measures, while those who receive diagnoses can expect more personalised
treatments and a lower risk of adverse drug reactions.</p>
<p>The true power of precision medicine, however, is that it will provide
a deeper understanding of ourselves and what goes wrong in the context
of disease. The genetic, lifestyle and environmental data collected will
shed light on the causes of disease and what can be done to avoid or ameliorate
them. Importantly, this understanding will lead to better ways of diagnosing
different diseases and the development of urgently needed new treatments.</p>
