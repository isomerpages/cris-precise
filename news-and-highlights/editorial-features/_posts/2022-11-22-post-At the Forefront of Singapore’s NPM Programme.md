<p><em>As the captain of the National Precision Medicine programme, Dr. Claire Bellis from A*STAR’s Genome Institute of Singapore is ensuring that the programme functions like a well-oiled machine and is helping Singaporeans live healthier lives.</em>
</p>
<p>Launched in 2017, Singapore’s National Precision Medicine (NPM) programme
aims to provide a near-complete assessment of the common genetic variants
in Singapore’s major ethnic groups. Achieving this mammoth task requires
consistent collaboration across the&nbsp;academic medical community, healthcare
community, public research institutes, and private companies&nbsp;to develop
the&nbsp; necessary infrastructure and capabilities that would support
the collection, storage and processing of genetic data for disease studies.</p>
<p>The intricacies of this endeavour can be likened to the operation of a
sophisticated machine, where stakeholders play different parts to ensure
its functionality. Realising the complexity of this process, Professor
Patrick Tan, Executive Director of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.npm.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_self">Precision Health Research, Singapore (PRECISE)</a>&nbsp;and
GIS, enlisted the help of talents&nbsp;from a myriad of institutes within
A*STAR, including Dr. Claire Bellis from GIS, clinicians and researchers
located at major hospitals and universities in Singapore who literally
have their fingers on the pulse of the health of Singapore. “If we were
to imagine the entire programme as an engine or machine, I would consider
my role the oil for all the moving cogs; ensuring programme objectives,
deliverables, deadlines, key-stakeholders, etc., are all aligned, running
as smoothly as possible”, Dr. Bellis says. In her work so far, Dr. Bellis
made sure the programme didn’t miss out on tapping on the best and brightest
of Singapore’s knowledge assets in precision medicine.</p>
<p><strong>Engine development</strong>
</p>
<p>Singapore’s NPM approach is based on best global practices&nbsp; and includes
three strategic phases: Proof of Concept ( which aims to sequence 10,000
healthy individuals), Proof of Value ( a long-term study to collect genomic
data from 100,000 individuals), and Proof of Scale (a mission to sequence
up to one million genomes). Together, they will &nbsp;result in embedding
genetics in clinics, generation of Asian-specific disease risk modelsand
catalysing local genomics industries through local startups.&nbsp;“When
we started with Phase I of SG10K implementation, various learning opportunities
were identified through pain point analyses”, she shares.&nbsp; “One such
bottleneck we identified was associated with the supply of DNA samples
to “feed” the sequencing instruments”. This learning opportunity paved
the way for the establishment of the n<strong>EXT</strong>&nbsp;gene<strong>R</strong>ation&nbsp;<strong>A</strong>utomated&nbsp;<strong>C</strong>entre
for high-throughput sample processing and robo<strong>T</strong>ics laboratory,
or simply EXTRACT. EXTRACT uses next-generation robotics to enable large-scale
DNA extraction capability and bridge the resource gap in institutions that
also need to recruit participants and perform sample phenotyping as part
of SG100K. The establishment of this onsite lab freed up resources that
could be diverted into non-repetitive tasks in line with the future phases
of the programme. Employing robotics also reduces possible human errors
in processing samples.</p>
<p>The foundation has been laid, and the machine buzzes as collaborators
pitch their initiatives. But what is next for Singapore’s NPM programme?
When a team from the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abj6987" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Telomere-2-Telomere (T2T) Consortium</a>&nbsp;mapped
the missing ~8% of the human genome and completed the book of life’s missing
chapters, scientists globally were promised access to a complete reference
genome to further genomic research. Although this reference genome is based
on approximately 3,000 individuals from diverse ancestries, it is imperative
to generate a local Singaporean reference where unique variations and patterns
in the genome may give rise to more confident conclusions on matters impacting
public health.</p>
<p>“The last decade has witnessed the most aggressive advancements in genome
sequencing. This is great news for precision medicine programmes aiming
to sequence at the population scale”, she adds. Precision medicine has
been shown, for a variety of conditions, to predict the onset of disease
before the healthy individual presents to the clinic with symptoms. Further,
the success of Singapore’s NPM will allow local physicians access to the
SG100K database to understand the frequency of certain genome variations
in the population and whether, for example, any known adverse drug responses
have been detected, before prescribing a particular medication. “Prevention
is better than cure, after all. As such, NPM aims to sequence 100,000 genomes.”,
Dr. Bellis quips.</p>
<p><strong>Cost considerations</strong>
</p>
<p>Given that the first successful attempt at sequencing the human genome
in 2001 cost a staggering USD$1,000,000,000, one may wonder how a population
approach to this framework can be realised. “The answer is technology disruptors”,
Dr. Bellis notes. The recent years saw a significant reduction in sequencing
costs due to lowered computing power costs. The idea of a US$100 genome
has even been put on the table by startup Ultima Genomics. Cost reduction,
complemented by technological advancements using long-read sequencing approaches,
is making every country’s national precision medicine agenda closer to
reality. “Using a long-read sequencing technique, the fastest sequence
of a human genome record was set. At only 5 hours and 2 minutes, this feat
elicited tremendous excitement throughout the precision medicine, health
and diagnostics fields”, she shares. “This advancement truly delivers on
the promise of genome sequencing integration into routine medicine.”</p>
<p><strong>Maximising performance</strong>
</p>
<p>Aside from reviewing and evaluating pre-print manuscripts for potential
novel studies that may be adopted in the local context, Dr. Bellis capitalises
on longstanding relationships with institutions that harbour the same goal.
“I have been lucky enough to foster working relationships with groups such
as the&nbsp;<em><a href="https://allofus.nih.gov/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">All of Us</a></em>&nbsp;Research
Program in the United States,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.genomicsengland.co.uk/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Genomics England</a>, and&nbsp;
<a href="https://ki.se/en/research/ki-biobank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Karolinska Institute Biobank</a>, each of which has truly assisted with
knowledge transfer associated with GIS’ EXTRACT Lab”, she notes. Dr. Bellis
believes that there is a strong justification to develop a similar collaborative
ecosystem in Singapore. “For precision medicine to assist Singaporeans
with their health and medical requirements, we need access to genomes of
our local population.” This is what NPM hopes to achieve – to not only
create the necessary infrastructure, but also train local talent and extend
them access to the rare resource.</p>
<p>Ensuring the NPM’s complex and highly-collaborative system functions smoothly,
like a well-oiled machine, is anything but simple. It comes with potential
roadblocks and uphill slopes that the NPM, through Dr. Bellis navigates.
“The uniqueness of one’s genome sequence can be likened to a biological
footprint or a digital twin. It is also a window that peeks into a person’s
possible health scenarios, hence, trust between researchers and study participants
will need to be nurtured by engaging the public”, she says.</p>
<p>The good thing is Singapore has government-mandated governance and policies
in place to cover health data sharing and privacy preservation concerns.</p>
<p>Dr. Bellis hopes that in the future NPM will reach a stage of maturity
where the genome and clinical data of over one million Singaporeans, possibly
the entire population is analysed. “When realised, this opens up tremendous
potential for clinicians and researchers alike to generate patient-specific
diagnoses for a range of diseases, earlier and with greater confidence”,
she envisions.</p>
