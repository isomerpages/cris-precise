<p>When Singapore launched its National Precision Medicine (NPM) initiative
a decade ago, it was a calculated bet that the nation’s unique genetic
diversity and well-coordinated healthcare system would propel precision
medicine to the next frontier. That bet is now entering a pivotal phase:
proof of scale as precision medicine expands from healthy cohorts to diverse
patient populations.</p>

<p>“The question is no longer whether precision medicine can generate insights,
but whether those insights can be translated into real-world patient outcomes,
sustainably and equitably,” says Professor Patrick Tan, Executive Director
of Precision Health Research, Singapore (PRECISE).</p>
<h3><strong>Building on a Strong Foundation</strong></h3>
<p>The journey began with <a href="/sg10k-discoveries-from-mapping-10000-genomes/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Phase 1</a>,
a proof of concept stage that delivered Southeast Asia’s first large-scale
genetic reference panel. This was more than just a research achievement;
it established the foundational datasets, sequencing expertise, and governance
frameworks necessary to conduct precision medicine responsibly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Phase II upped the ante on complexity, not only analysing the genetic
information of 100,000 individuals but integrating that data with non-genetic
information like electronic health records, lifestyle information, and
environmental factors. It was a deliberate step toward reflecting the multifaceted
nature of human health, where genes interact with life experiences and
clinical histories.</p>
<p></p>
<p>One key way Phase II put precision medicine into practice was through
a suite of <a href="/clinical-implementation-pilot/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">clinical implementation pilots</a> (CIPs),
spanning familial hypercholesterolemia, breast cancer screening, hereditary
cancers, kidney disease, and pharmacogenetics. In parallel, Phase II also
saw the launch of a research consortium with multinational pharmaceutical
companies including <a href="/precise-illumina-partnership-agreement/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Illumina</a> and <a href="/boehringer-ingelheim-partners-with-precision-health-research/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Boehringer Ingelheim</a>,
leveraging the PRECISE-SG100K dataset to drive drug discovery, validate
biomarkers and develop therapies tailored to Asian populations.</p>
<p>As a proof of scale, Phase III is even more ambitious. Rather than focusing
on healthy cohorts, it aims to capture the lived realities of patients
within healthcare settings. This shift reflects the central ambition: not
simply to generate knowledge, but to transform how healthcare is delivered-more
targeted, more cost-effective, and ultimately more impactful.</p>
<h3><strong>From Discovery to Delivery</strong></h3>
<p>The defining feature of Phase III is the quest to understanding patients,
not just healthy individuals. With a target of enrolling about 10% of Singapore’s
population, this phase also dramatically expands the scale. This scale
matters: it allows researchers to detect rare variants, capture greater
diversity, and generate the statistical power required to translate findings
into clinical certainty. For patients, this could eventually mean earlier
diagnoses, more accurate treatment choices, and interventions that are
targeted to their risk profile rather than a one-size-fits-all standard
of care.</p>
<p>But scale is only part of the story. By focusing on patients, Phase III
places precision medicine squarely in the real world-where comorbidities,
cost pressures, and clinical decision-making come into play. This requires
moving beyond the walls of research institutes to partner directly with
hospitals, clinics, and primary care providers across all of Singapore’s
three healthcare clusters: NHG Health, National University Health System
(NUHS) and Singapore Health Services (SingHealth).</p>
<p>“Singapore is realising the potential of genomics with strategy and scale—a
strong public mandate, world-class infrastructure and the willingness to
commit long-term,” says Tiffany Boughtwood, the Australian Health Genomics
Commissioner. She guides the work of Genomics Australia, the country’s
nationwide effort to better integrate genomics into the health system.
“Genomics in Singapore is poised to transition beyond research to a tool
embedded across clinical service delivery.”</p>
<p>This phase of the NPM arrives at a critical policy juncture as Singapore
makes the monumental shift from reactive to preventative healthcare. Confronted
by a rapidly aging population and the rising burden of chronic diseases,
Singapore is in the midst of a bold reimagining of how healthcare can be
delivered both sustainably and at the high quality its citizens have come
to expect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The government has launched several initiatives to empower Singaporeans
to manage their own health, supported by affordable screenings and vaccinations
under the guidance of family doctors. Phase III of the NPM powerfully complements
this agenda, not by replacing population-level interventions but ensuring
that they are targeted more effectively. Precision insights could, for
example, identify which individuals would benefit most from early screening
for cancer or cardiovascular disease, allowing limited healthcare resources
to be deployed where they have the greatest impact.</p>
<h3><strong>Local Data, Global Impact</strong></h3>
<p>While firmly focused on serving the local population, Phase III will also
have an impact that extends far beyond Singapore. By complementing global
efforts with high quality data from underrepresented Asian populations,
Phase III will help improve equity and enhance the accuracy of global datasets
while validating findings in the Singaporean population. More accurate
data means more accurate diagnoses and treatments, not only for Singaporeans
but for populations across Asia and the world.</p>
<p>“What excites me is Singapore’s ability to show the world how to do this
responsibly at scale-building the standards, policies, and trust that make
genomics part of everyday care,” says Dame Sue Hill Professor, Chief Scientific
Officer of the National Health Service (NHS) England. “The big bet now
is on creating an integrated system that combines patient genomic data
with relevant clinical and diagnostic data in near real time, allowing
discoveries to directly benefit patient care.”</p>
<p>However, connecting the dots between millions of data points for a single
individual-and then scaling that up for 450,000 participants-is the critical
challenge of Phase III. It calls for the linking of different kinds of
data-from strings of genetic data to survey responses and diagnostic images-each
an illuminating dataset on its own but made more powerful when combined.
The task is not only technical but also organisational, demanding interoperability
across healthcare systems, rigorous privacy safeguards through secure data
architectures, and analytical pipelines that can surface clinically relevant
insights from the noise.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the journey ahead is daunting and success is not guaranteed, past
efforts put Singapore in a favourable position to tackle this challenge
head on. “If there’s any country in the world that can do it, it’s Singapore,”
says Professor Aarno Palotie, scientific director of FinnGen, a public-private
partnership that combines lifelong heath data and genomic data in Finland
and a founding member of PRECISE's scientific advisory board. Singapore
shows the world that to make precision medicine truly count, you must invest
not just in genomics, but in systems that ensure it is equitable, sustainable
and ethically robust.”</p>
