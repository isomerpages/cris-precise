<p><em>From early insights into regional variations in drug response to an ambitious transnational project to consolidate genomic data, 2021 saw advances in precision medicine across the board.</em>
</p>
<p>Nearly twenty years after the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.genome.gov/human-genome-project" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">human genome was first sequenced</a>,
advances in genomics research have grown by leaps and bounds. Aided in
part by the shrinking costs of sequencing technologies, analysing the mysteries
of the human genome has never been cheaper—and more accessible. And as
more countries kickstart their own genomic sequencing initiatives, a new
paradigm has emerged: precision medicine, which accounts for the influence
of genetics, environment and lifestyle on populations and individuals.</p>
<p>It’s no wonder then that 2021 has seen numerous genomics and precision
medicine initiatives come into the fore. Here’s a recap of some of the
most significant developments in the field in the past year.</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Singaporean genomes in the spotlight</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Despite its small size, Singapore is home to around&nbsp;<a href="/thought-leader-feature-prof-john-chambers/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">80 percent of Asia’s genetic diversity</a>&nbsp;thanks
to the three ethnic groups—Chinese, Malay and Indian—on its sunny shores.
With Asian populations historically underrepresented in genomic databases,
the ethnically diverse city-state is well-poised to drive advances in genomics
research and precision medicine.</p>
<p>Singapore has laid out a 10-year plan called the <a href="/singapore-launches-next-phase-of-national-precision-medicine/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">National Precision Medicine (NPM) Strategy</a> .
Phase I, which took place from 2017 to 2019, culminated in the&nbsp;
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2019.09.019" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">world’s largest genetic databank for multi-ethnic Asian populations</a>.
Earlier this year in April, Phase II was launched to glean further insights
by analysing the genetic makeup of 100,000 healthy Singaporeans and some
disease cohorts. Driven by&nbsp;<strong>Precision Health Research, Singapore (PRECISE),</strong>&nbsp;Phase
II will also see the pilot implementation of precision medicine in clinical
practices and focus on creating new economic opportunities that leverage
new findings from genetic studies—transforming healthcare in the country
for the better.</p>
<ol start="2" data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Predicting drug responses in Southeast Asian populations</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In the precision medicine approach to therapeutic treatment, it’s all
about delivering the right drug to the right patient at the right time.
Regionally, researchers are striving to achieve this goal through efforts
like the&nbsp;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1159/000502916" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Southeast Asian Pharmacogenomics Research Network (SEAPharm)</a>,
which aims to use sequencing to study pharmacogenomics, or how certain
genes can affect the way a person reacts to drugs.</p>
<p>In 2021, SEAPharm published a study in&nbsp;<em>Human Genome Variation</em>&nbsp;that&nbsp;
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41439-021-00135-z" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">sequenced 100 individuals from all over Southeast Asia</a>&nbsp;to discover
the pharmacogenetic variants present2. Notably, they found substantial
variations at 100 genetic locations, contributing to differences in drug
responses among populations within and between countries. While this study
is only preliminary, further research may someday help local physicians
prescribe drugs more likely to be effective in their respective populations.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Illuminating immunity across Asia</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>From the lush tropics of India to the mountains of South Korea, Asia is
home to a dizzying array of stunning environments and unique wildlife.
Despite the diversity of its 4.5 billion-strong population, the region’s
population remains underrepresented in genomic studies.&nbsp;&nbsp;Enter&nbsp;
<a href="https://chanzuckerberg.com/science/programs-resources/single-cell-biology/seednetworks/asian-immune-diversity-atlas/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">AIDA (Asian Immune Diversity Atlas)3,</a>&nbsp;which is set to be the
first large-scale effort to characterise immune cell diversity in Asian
populations. Using single-cell sequencing technologies, the project’s researchers
will analyse the composition of immune cells in healthy individuals from
20 distinct populations in eight Asian countries, namely: Singapore, Japan,
South Korea, India, Thailand, Russia, Pakistan and Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>Equipped with this data, the atlas will provide a baseline measurement
of the immune system in health individuals—allowing the identification
of abnormalities across diverse immune-related diseases, metabolic disorders
and cancers. The project is funded by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative grant,
with similar atlases also in the works in Latin America and North America.</p>

<p><strong>Rebuilding Tohoku’s genomic infrastructure</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In March 2011, Japan’s northeast coast was jolted by the largest recorded
earthquake in the country’s history: a magnitude-9.0 event that triggered
a massive tsunami reaching up to 40 metres in height—flatlining buildings
and impacting crucial structures like the Fukushima Daiichi reactors. Among
those affected by the earthquake were medical databases and biobanks, resulting
in the establishment of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.megabank.tohoku.ac.jp/english/about/outline/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Tohoku Medical Megabank Organization</a>4.</p>
<p>Hosted by Tohoku University and headed by Executive Director Masayuki
Yamamoto, the organization aims to rebuild the region’s community medical
system through several initiatives, including assembling a biobank with
medical and genome information. 2021 marked the start of the biobank project’s
third stage and will focus on carrying out a long-term health survey in
the areas impacted by the earthquake ten years prior, as well as the building
up of a biobank with information from 150,000 individuals.</p>

<p><strong>Diagnosing rare diseases with whole genome sequencing</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For individuals with rare disease, diagnosis is often elusive—with years
of unnecessary and costly tests building up to what is called a ‘diagnostic
odyssey.’ However, recent results from the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.genomicsengland.co.uk/about-genomics-england/the-100000-genomes-project/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">UK’s 100,000 Genomes Project</a>&nbsp;indicate
that whole genome sequencing (WGS) may soon turn the tide.&nbsp;According
to the pilot study published this year in the&nbsp;<em>New England Journal of Medicine</em>,
WGS led to diagnoses for 25 percent of around 2,000 participants thought
to have a rare genetic condition5. Among this cohort, 14 percent would
not have been diagnosed through conventional means like exome sequencing,
which only looks at the genome’s protein-coding regions.</p>
<p>While the study revealed WGS’ potential to end the protracted diagnostic
odyssey for some patients, it also underscored the complexity of genetics
in disease. For instance, WGS provided diagnoses for 35 percent of cases
when the condition was linked to just one gene. But for conditions rooted
in multiple genes, only 11 percent of cases received a diagnosis. Still,
it’s early days yet. The next phase of the project will involve the sequencing
of 500,000 whole genomes in rare disease and cancer in healthcare.</p>
<p>Though many of these efforts may still be ongoing, they represent yet
another fruitful period laying the groundwork for a scientific and healthcare
system driven by precision medicine. In the years to come, it is clear
that insights from these efforts will shape the way we approach health
as well as detect, diagnose and manage disease for the better—so stay tuned!</p>
