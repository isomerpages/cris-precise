<p><em>By using the genome as their guide, clinicians and researchers can enhance diagnosis and treatment in cardiac diseases.</em>
</p>
<p>For most of his young life, ‘Peter’ was a happy and healthy boy. That
was until he turned 11 and began to experience repeated episodes of full-blown
blackouts during exercise. Peter was soon diagnosed with syncope, the medical
term for fainting1.</p>
<p>While syncope was known to be a temporary drop in blood flow to the brain,
the underlying cause remained a mystery. For instance, syncope could be
caused by anything from an overreaction to triggers like the sight of blood
or an irregular heartbeat—making diagnostic odyssey often a lengthy and
complex affair. But for patients like Peter, a definitive diagnosis would
be critical, allowing clinicians to finally prescribe the right treatment.
Thankfully, an answer for Peter was just around the corner, in the form
of precision medicine.</p>
<p>While the goal of medicine has always been to arrive at a correct diagnosis
and choose the best treatment using available information, precision medicine
seeks to strengthen current practice by integrating molecular, environment
and even lifestyle data for more accurate diagnosis and risk stratification.</p>
<p>On local shores, clinician-scientists from the National Heart Centre Singapore
(NHCS) have been pivotal in advancing the use of precision medicine in
cardiology in recent years. Here are their stories.</p>
<p><strong>A family affair</strong>
</p>
<p>When Peter was first referred to Clinical Assistant Professor Eric Lim,
a Senior Consultant at the NHCS’ Inherited Cardiac Conditions (ICC) Clinic,
the team found that everything—from family history, medical history to
his physical examination—was normal. The only indication of an issue was
an unusual pattern on an electrocardiogram (ECG) during exercise. Even
then, analysis of the ECG proved inconclusive. After all, various conditions
could potentially cause the pattern, including the genetic disorder Brugada
syndrome, which causes an irregular heartbeat, to arryhthmogenic right
ventricular cardiomyopathy, where fatty tissue replaces normal heart muscle.</p>
<p>To probe the origins of the pattern, the team administered a sodium channel
blocker flecainide to members of his family and see if there were any changes
to their ECGs. “We didn’t dare give Peter a sodium channel blocker, because
if we did and he did have a sodium channel problem, then it could be fatal,”
explained Clin Asst Prof Lim.</p>
<p>Hoping to piece together Peter’s puzzling condition, the team turned to
a fundamental tenet of precision medicine: genome sequencing. After sequencing
Peter’s DNA, they struck gold by finding two mutations in the SCN5A gene,
which provides instructions for making a channel that transports sodium
into heart cells2.</p>
<p>Opening and closing at specific times to control the flow of sodium atoms,
these channels play a key role in signalling the start of each heartbeat.
Peter’s mutations, however, led to a truncated version of the SCN5A protein,
impairing the channel’s function and causing his syncope. Remarkably, they
found his sister also had one SCN5A mutation—prompting the team to continue
monitoring her health in case she develops similar symptoms. By marrying
clinical findings to genetics, Clin Asst Prof Lim was able to precisely
explain the nature of the underlying condition and provide answers for
Peter and his family.</p>
<p><strong>Finding new uses for old drugs</strong>
</p>
<p>Not only can precision medicine provide answers for the individuals like
Peter, but it can also provide potential solutions. There are over 20,000
drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), most of which
were developed to treat one condition or symptom. Yet, in recent years,
researchers have begun to expand the repertoire of such drugs by testing
existing treatments against new conditions.</p>
<p>Assistant Professor Chrishan Ramachandra, a Senior Research Fellow at
NHCS, uses induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS) to do just that. First
created by Nobel Laureate Dr Shinya Yamanaka, iPS cells are made from specialised
adult cells that have been reprogrammed to an unspecialised, stem cell-like
state, akin to winding back the clock. Accordingly, scientists like Asst
Prof Ramachandra are now working on harvesting blood cells, inducing them
to the unspecialised state, and reprogramming them into heart cells—creating
new cells specific to an individual patient.</p>
<p>He&nbsp;used this approach to create laboratory models of patients with
long QT syndrome, a cardiac condition caused by a mutation in the KCHN2
gene that controls the transport of potassium out of heart cells. Left
unchecked, the syndrome could result in fainting, seizures and in extreme
cases, sudden death3.</p>
<p>As both cystic fibrosis and long QT syndrome are caused by defects in
transport proteins, he hypothesised that medication used to treat cystic
fibrosis, like the drug Orkambi, could be applied to long QT syndrome.
He was right.</p>
<p>Incredibly, the team managed to restore normal channel function in the
long QT syndrome models. The next step is to test Orkambi in clinical trials.
As Orkambi is FDA-approved, they can jump straight to phase 2 clinical
trials, cutting out an expensive and time-consuming part of drug development.</p>
<p><strong>Plenty of room for growth</strong>
</p>
<p>While precision medicine in cardiology is still in its infancy, the work
performed by Clin Asst Prof Lim and Asst Prof Ramachandra is cause for
excitement. The drivers of precision medicine such as the lowering costs
of genome sequencing and a deeper understanding of biological processesare
improving every day, which will only accelerate its usage in cardiology.</p>
<p>“Clinical genetics is starting to make an impact in cardiovascular medicine
for diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic decision making,”&nbsp;stated
Clin Asst Prof Lim at a webinar held on 27 July 2021 as part of the SingHealth
Duke-NUS Genomic Medicine Centre Seminar Series. Taken together, the future
of precision medicine in cardiology is not only exciting, but inevitable.</p>
