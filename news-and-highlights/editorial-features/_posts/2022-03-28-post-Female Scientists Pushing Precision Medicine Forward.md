<p><strong><em>In celebration of International Women’s Month, meet seven women who are advancing precision medicine in Singapore.</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Across social, economic and political spheres, diversity and inclusion
has led to a flourishing of valuable ideas and even&nbsp;<a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/04/business-case-for-diversity-in-the-workplace/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">increased revenue</a>.
The benefits of diversity are particularly relevant when it comes to healthcare:
the perspectives and experiences of women are vital to develop medical
advancements that are effective for all people. However, while women make
up almost&nbsp;<a href="https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/311314/WHO-HIS-HWF-Gender-WP1-2019.1-eng.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">70 per cent</a>&nbsp;of
the global healthcare workforce, they have been historically underrepresented
in medical research. Until 1993, women were&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fda.gov/science-research/womens-health-research/gender-studies-product-development-historical-overview#:~:text=In%201993%2C%20FDA%20explicitly%20reversed,to%20be%20analyzed%20to%20assess" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">actively excluded</a>&nbsp;from
clinical trials in the United States if they were under 40 years old and
considered of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fda.gov/science-research/womens-health-research/gender-studies-product-development-historical-overview#:~:text=In%201993%2C%20FDA%20explicitly%20reversed,to%20be%20analyzed%20to%20assess" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">childbearing potential</a>.
A 2020&nbsp;<a href="https://news.uchicago.edu/story/women-are-overmedicated-because-drug-dosage-trials-are-done-men-study-finds" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">study</a>&nbsp;from
the University of Chicago found that women tend to be overmedicated and
experience excess side effects from medication because clinical drug trials
are predominantly carried out on male bodies.</p>
<p>Such research gaps can lead to inefficiencies when treating and diagnosing
female patients. Fortunately, precision medicine aims to address these
gaps by considering the vast genetic differences between diverse populations
for more representative and accurate treatment. In Singapore, several women
have been contributing to the precision medicine landscape. In celebration
of International Women’s Day, we take a look at seven of them and the impact
of their work.</p>
<p><strong>Yasmin Bylstra</strong>
</p>
<p>For over two decades, genetic counsellor Yasmin Bylstra has been interpreting
and explaining genetic results to&nbsp;<a href="/making-genetics-a-family-affair/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">individuals and their families</a>&nbsp;who
are at risk of genetic diseases. As the Principal Genetic Counsellor at
the SingHealth Duke-NUS Institute of Precision Medicine (PRISM), she develops
and streamlines precision medicine protocols for critical processes like
informed consent, return of results and findings management. Recently,
her work involves the&nbsp;<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pmedr.2020.101072" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">collection and application</a>&nbsp;of
data for identifying patients at risk of genetic diseases. Working closely
with patients and managing genome sequencing results, Yasmin brings precision
medicine approaches to the clinic as a patient-focused healthcare solution
rather than a solely academic pursuit.</p>
<p><strong>Li Jingmei</strong>
</p>
<p>Dr Li Jingmei is currently the Group Leader at A*STAR’s Genome Institute
of Singapore’s (GIS) Women’s Health and Genetics laboratory. At GIS, Li
and her team are committed to driving Singapore’s women’s health research
through a variety of efforts—from genetic sequencing to assessing the general
public’s attitudes toward breast cancer screening. &nbsp;In particular,
Li’s work focuses on the&nbsp;<a href="/empowering-breakthroughs-in-breast-cancer-care/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_self">prevention and early detection of breast cancer</a>.
Typically, family history remains the primary measurement for breast cancer
risk, but Li and her team have noticed that such information is becoming
more difficult to obtain. Through her research, she hopes to identify genetic
differences that can be found in a person’s genome—pointing to a more accurate
indication of risk. Over the course of her career, Li has been awarded
the 2017 Singapore Young Scientist Award as well as a 2014 L’Oréal-UNESCO
For Women in Science International Fellowship.</p>
<p><strong>Claire Bellis</strong>
</p>
<p>As the Senior Programme Manager for the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.a-star.edu.sg/gis/our-science/precision-medicine-and-population-genomics/npm" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">National Precision Medicine (NPM) Programme</a>,
Dr Claire Bellis plays a key role in driving Singapore’s major precision
medicine efforts. Through the programme, Bellis and her team intend to
transform medical treatments from a one-size-fits-all approach to highly-effective
tailored therapies and diagnoses. To that end, the team is currently working
on sequencing the genomes of 100,000 Singaporeans to gain a better understanding
of the intersection between Asian health and genomics. In fact, a recent
2019 paper&nbsp;<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2019.09.019" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">by Bellis and her collaborators</a>&nbsp;garnered
global attention for being the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.a-star.edu.sg/News/a-star-news/news/press-releases/singapore-completes-world-s-largest-whole-genome-sequencing-analysis-of-multi-ethnic-asian-populations" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">world’s largest whole genome sequencing analysis of multi-ethnic Asian populations</a>.
The study sequenced the genomes of almost 5,000 Singaporeans—providing
significant insights into the genetic diversity of Asian populations and
validating the programme’s proof-of-concept while demonstrating the capabilities
of A*STAR’s GIS and wider NPM ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong>Sonia Davila</strong>
</p>
<p>Professor Sonia Davila, Deputy Director of the SingHealth Duke-NUS Institute
of Precision Medicine (PRISM) and Director of Research at the SingHealth
Duke-NUS Genomic Medicine Centre, has identified genetic mutations involved
in immune-related diseases, infectious and autoimmune disorders, rare diseases
like Kawasaki disease and polycystic liver disease among others. Most recently,
Davila was part of a team that conducted a large-scale study on steroid-resistant
nephrotic syndrome—a rare kidney disorder that can progress to end-stage
kidney disease. Their study,&nbsp;<a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/cge.14116" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Deciphering Diversities: Renal Asian Genetics Network (DRAGoN)</a>,
focused specifically on identifying disease risk in Asian patients. Davila
hopes to advance genomic medicine and precision medicine as a practical
clinical tool capable of benefitting patients across the globe—no matter
how rare their disease.</p>
<p><strong>Foo Jia Nee</strong>
</p>
<p>Professor Foo Jia Nee is the Nanyang Assistant Professor at the Lee Kong
Chian School of Medicine at Nanyang Technological University. Foo is also
a Senior Research Scientist at A*STAR’s GIS where her team looks at genetic
changes that influence the risk of neurodegenerative diseases, childhood
neurological diseases, mental health and neurocognitive issues as well
as other genetic conditions. In line with Singapore’s goal of championing
precision medicine in Asia, one of Foo’s most significant studies<a href="/female-scientists-pushing-precision-medicine-forward/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_self">[1]</a>&nbsp;was
the first and largest Han Chinese Genome-wide association study on Parkinson’s
disease, done in collaboration with the National Neuroscience Institute
and a consortium of researchers across East Asia. The people of Han Chinese
ethnicity make up almost a fifth of the world’s population, thus a better
understanding of how genomic differences affect their risk of Parkinson’s
disease can greatly advance precise therapies and diagnosis in East Asia.</p>
<p><strong>Neerja Karnani</strong>
</p>
<p>Neerja Karnani is a Senior Principal Investigator and the Head of Clinical
Data Engagement at A*STAR’s Bioinformatics Institute. She and her team
use integrated omics approaches and clinical data science to improve diagnostics
and develop interventions for chronic diseases. Simultaneously, she is
the Systems Biology Lead at Singapore Institute for Clinical Sciences,
A*STAR. There, Karnani developed a multi-omics roadmap to identify the
molecular phenotypes of metabolic and mental health adversities in expecting
mothers and their babies. Karnani is also Adjunct Associate Professor at
the National University of Singapore’s Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine
where she studies the developmental and intergenerational lipid signatures
of obesity. This year, Karnani aims to create customized health apps powered
by next generation diagnostic tests that combine precision medicine research
and electronic health records with real-world data from the public health
sector.</p>
<p><strong>Marie Loh</strong>
</p>
<p>Assistant Professor Marie Loh from the Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine
at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore is an award-winning molecular
epidemiologist. As part of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ntu.edu.sg/medicine/research/research-programmes/population-health" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Population and Global Health research programme</a>,
she investigates the role of genetics and epigenetics underlying ethnic
differences in the risk and outcomes of complex diseases. By combining
population health with molecular phenotyping and laboratory-based approaches,
her group aims to understand the susceptibility to cardiometabolic and
skin diseases, with a specific focus in how these diseases present in Asian
populations.</p>
<p>Loh is currently working on understanding the genetic underpinnings of
obesity, type 2 diabetes and dilated cardiomyopathy, as well as the interaction
between the skin microbiome and epigenome in atopic dermatitis. At the
same time, she is also a Senior Research Scientist at the National Skin
Centre and an Honorary Senior Lecturer at Imperial College London.</p>
