<p><strong>The discovery of an Asian variant of the NOTCH3 gene opens the doors for a precision medicine approach to young-onset dementia.</strong>
</p>
<p>Have you ever been teased by your friends because you left your earphones
at home or you forgot someone’s birthday? You must be getting old, they
joke. While forgetfulness is often dismissed as merely a sign of ageing,
in younger adults, it could hint at a more serious medical condition: dementia.</p>
<p>Caused by a lack of blood flow to the brain, vascular dementia refers
to a broad class of symptoms that affect mental ability, leading to impaired
memory, logic and attention, sometimes even triggering volatile moods that
affect social interactions. While generally a condition of old age, several
forms of vascular dementia, particularly those that are genetic and heritable,
can arise in younger adults.</p>
<p>In Singapore, an increasing number of young people in their 40s and 50s
have been diagnosed with vascular dementia. In a 2020 interview1&nbsp;with
SingHealth, Associate Professor Nagaendran Kandiah, Senior Consultant at
the National Neuroscience Institute’s Department of Neurology, said that
genes play a bigger role in young-onset dementia, explaining some 20 to
30 percent of cases, as opposed to only five percent in the elderly.</p>
<p>Because it combines the traditional factors of family history, brain imaging
and blood chemistry with cutting-edge genetic analysis, precision medicine
could potentially facilitate the early detection of dementia in young adults.
But the lack of studies in Asians leaves precision medicine with few genetic
culprits to look for.</p>
<p><strong>A genetic suspect</strong>
</p>
<p>In a recent study2, a group of researchers created their own custom-designed
screening panel containing 200 neurodegeneration-related genes, in hopes
of finally pinning down a potential genetic explanation for young-onset
dementia in a subset of this population.</p>
<p>Led by Dr Adeline Ng of the National Neuroscience Institute, the team,
which included investigators from Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, A*STAR,
and SingHealth Duke-NUS Institute of Precision Medicine, recruited adults
of Southeast Asian descent suspected to have an inherited form of vascular
dementia.</p>
<p>By combining their custom gene panel with magnetic resonance brain imaging,
they found that 20 of the 45 participants—most of whom were predominantly
Chinese—indeed had tiny alterations in their genes that were either disease-causing
or predicted to have a similar effect. This translated to a diagnostic
yield of 44.4 percent, meaning that of 10 young adults coming into the
clinic with signs of possible genetic dementia, at least four will leave
with a definitive diagnosis.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, 17 of the 20 genetic diagnoses were of CADASIL, a rare form
of vascular dementia caused by mutations to the&nbsp;<em>NOTCH3</em>&nbsp;gene.
As they looked deeper into these mutations, the researchers saw that 76.5
percent of their CADASIL patients harboured a particular variant of&nbsp;<em>NOTCH3</em>&nbsp;called
R544C, a mutation predominantly seen in East Asians.</p>
<p>“We found that CADASIL remains the most common cause of inherited vascular
dementia in Singapore, and that the most common variant seen in our CADASIL
cases was the ‘East Asian’&nbsp;<em>NOTCH3</em>&nbsp;R544C variant,” Ng
said. “This changes practice as we now have a specific target we can look
at for detecting vascular dementia early.”</p>
<p>The identification of this specific variant of interest opens up the possibility
of a precision medicine approach to dementia in young Asian adults, which
will allow doctors detect these conditions earlier and help scientists
come up with specific and more effective treatments.</p>
<p><strong>Catching community carriers</strong>
</p>
<p>Not only is CADASIL genetically distinct in Asians, but Ng and her team
also showed that the unique&nbsp;<em>NOTCH3</em>&nbsp;R544C variant led
to notable differences in how the disease progressed.</p>
<p>For example, whereas Western CADASIL patients typically suffer from erosion
in the anterior temporal regions of the brain—the parts responsible for
memory and language—this phenomenon was markedly less common in Asian counterparts.</p>
<p>The research team noticed clear differences in warning signs, too. Thirty-five
percent of participants with genetically confirmed CADASIL had abnormalities
in their movement and motor skills, a set of symptoms collectively called
parkinsonism. In three patients, parkinsonism was even the very first symptom
to manifest. In contrast, parkinsonism is seen as a hallmark of advanced
CADASIL in Western patients; rarely manifesting early in the course of
the disease.</p>
<p>But pinning down a potential genetic cause and delineating racial differences
underlying young-onset dementia in Asians is only the first step, Ng said.
After all, the ultimate goal of precision medicine is to translate deeper
and more context-specific knowledge of diseases into better care and outcomes
for patients.</p>
<p>To this end, her team has started establishing a national baseline by
measuring just how widespread the Asian&nbsp;<em>NOTCH3</em>&nbsp;variant
is in Singapore. Looking farther ahead, Ng added, “We need resources to
determine if these carriers in the community can be screened for vascular
cognitive impairment through clinical evaluation and neuroimaging, as well
as given appropriate genetic counselling and treatment plans.” In the future,
as precision medicine becomes embedded in Singapore’s clinics, screening
for genetic dementia could become routine practice, ensuring early detection
for all.</p>
