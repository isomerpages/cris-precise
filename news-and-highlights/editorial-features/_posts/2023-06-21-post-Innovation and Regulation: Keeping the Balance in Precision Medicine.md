<p>From rare diseases to population health, developments in genomics and
precision medicine have the potential to change the lives of millions.
But given how fast the healthcare landscape is evolving, can regulation
safeguard the safety and welfare of our residents without stifling innovation
of new healthcare services and technologies?</p>

<p><strong>Staying ahead of the curve is important</strong>
</p>
<p>Adjunct Associate Professor Raymond Chua, Deputy Director-General of Health
(Health Regulation Group), Ministry of Health (MOH), answered, “It’s indeed
a challenge trying to balance this. As a regulator, MOH’s main objective
is always to ensure that the services and technologies remain safe to be
used by the public. However, it is also important to ensure that our regulations
do not impede new and innovative healthcare services and technologies which
could benefit Singaporeans too.</p>
<p>For example, in precision medicine, such innovations span from technologies
like artificial intelligence (AI) to therapies like gene editing, which
may potentially transform healthcare. There is often a phrase that ‘regulators
lag behind the industry’ and hence if the regulators don’t catch-up, then
the industry may not be able to launch the new technologies and services,
and the ones to lose out will be the patients. By scanning the horizon
proactively and engaging with industry players and professional bodies
regularly, we stay plugged in to what is new or in the pipeline. That enables
us to get a head start on reviewing our regulatory policies and tools,
and in some instances, opportunities to study the relevance of regulatory
measures other countries have put in place in our country.”</p>
<p><strong>Safety is the top priority—always</strong>
</p>
<p>By 2030, around one in four Singaporeans, will be aged 65 and above, according
to the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.strategygroup.gov.sg/files/media-centre/publications/Population-in-Brief-2022.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Population in Brief 2022</a>.&nbsp;A/Prof
Chua pointed out that, as we prepare for a ‘super-aged’ society, we expect
the demand for healthcare services to increase. “Against this backdrop,
our team at MOH’s Health Regulation Group has to strike a balance among
factors like safety, quality, accessibility and affordability. While safety
is a starting point, it is important to ensure that healthcare is also
accessible and affordable. That calls for streamlining regulations to ensure
that efficiency is not compromised, and more importantly, costs are not
unnecessarily passed on to care providers or consumers.”</p>
<p>That said, A/Prof Chua emphasised that “there is no question about it.
Our population’s safety and welfare come first. Increasingly, these segue
into the area of cybersecurity and data governance as digitalisation offers
new opportunities for personalised and preventive health. How can we protect
data and limit its access to authorised people, while balancing the need
to ensure the population can benefit timely from advancements arising from
data driven innovation?” He said this is particularly relevant to precision
medicine, which involves a lot of individualised data to empower learning
and insights, so as to enhance precision and nudge individuals towards
healthier lifestyles.</p>
<p><strong>Sandboxing as a means to explore enabling innovative services</strong>
</p>
<p>A/Prof Chua continued,&nbsp;“Slowly but surely, genomic medicine is transforming
our healthcare system at different points of the care pathway to enable
more personalised healthcare advice and treatment, earlier interventions,
better treatment outcomes and cost effectiveness. But first, we need to
set up an ecosystem, comprising proper processes manned by trained and
competent healthcare professionals, clear governance standards for institutions
providing genomic medicine, and strong data and cybersecurity infrastructure
to safeguard patient privacy and confidentiality.”</p>
<p>That led to the set-up of a regulatory sandbox in 2022 which&nbsp;<a href="https://npm.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_self">Precision Health Research, Singapore (PRECISE)</a>,&nbsp;
<a href="https://trustplatform.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Trusted Research and Real World-Data Utilisation and Sharing Tech (TRUST</a>)
<a href="https://trustplatform.sg/#_ftnref1" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">[1]</a>, healthcare institutions, insurance companies and genetic testing
service providers were a part of.</p>
<p>“It is essential to include all stakeholders in this journey because while
we may be regulating the space, we are not the ones offering the services
or implementing the model. We need partners like PRECISE to come in and
advise us on certain operational issues on the ground and safety gaps in
the system, so that we can offer appropriate ‘fit-for-purpose’ regulations.
A good example is the Moratorium that bans the use of genetic test results
from biomedical research and controls the use of predictive genetic tests
from clinical care in insurance underwriting,” said A/Prof Chua.</p>
<p>Although the sandbox has concluded, A/Prof Chua shared that the conversations
and MOH’s work are ongoing. “We continue to engage PRECISE to track the
effectiveness of regulations and enhance further. We are also analysing
findings from the sandbox providers to review how we can translate them
into policies, standards, and a set of laws that any clinic or hospital
providing genomic medicine will have to come under.”</p>
<p><strong>Balancing different forces and motion</strong>
</p>
<p>“Nonetheless, we are cognisant that the landscape is fast-changing and
what matters to service providers and consumers can be very different.
Thus, as much as we try to keep the equilibrium through regular stakeholder
engagements and regulatory enhancements. Ultimately, consumers have to
be better educated on how they can protect themselves. To help with that,
our team puts up knowledge pieces on our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthwatch.moh.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Health Watch</a>&nbsp;website,”
A/Prof Chua explained.</p>
<p>Referencing the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthiersg.gov.sg/resources/white-paper/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">White Paper on Healthier SG</a>&nbsp;released
in September 2022, which shared MOH’s multi-year strategy to transform
the national healthcare system by shifting the emphasis from reactive to
proactive preventive care, A/Prof Chua went on, “To meet the challenges
of an ageing population, we need solutions to transform our current healthcare
system. Instead of focusing our efforts on treating diseases, which is
the most expensive part of the care continuum, can we move into the preventive
and early detection spectrum by leveraging precision medicine? And while
we are at that, can we also ensure that information shared are secured
and used ethically so that people are not unnecessarily discriminated against
and disadvantaged when buying insurance or looking for jobs?”</p>
<p>“I believe a good regulatory regime and strong ethical safeguards are
what our population needs, coupled with well-educated consumer and competently
trained professionals—to benefit from opportunities that new technologies
like precision medicine and AI offer,” concluded A/Prof Chua.</p>

is a national platform that enables anonymised health-related research
and real-world data to be brought together, accessed and used in an expeditious
and secure manner. The platform supports health data analytics and innovation
between public institutions, and between the public and private sectors
to improve health outcomes. TRUST is co-developed by the Ministry of Health,
