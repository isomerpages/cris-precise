<p><em>From breast cancer screening to treatment selection, advances in precision diagnostics can pave the way towards more accurate predictions about clinical conditions and more effective care.</em>
</p>
<p>With Breast Cancer Awareness month commemorated every October, the pink
ribbon has become a well-recognised symbol to urge the public to undergo
breast cancer screening. In 2002, Singapore launched a nationwide breast
cancer screening programme, yet these services remain underutilised nearly
20 years later.</p>
<p>“Mammography screening has been proven to save lives by detecting the
tumour early when it’s small and most treatable,” emphasised Dr Jingmei
Li, Group Leader at the Agency for Science, Technology and Research’s&nbsp;
<a href="https://www.a-star.edu.sg/gis" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Genome Institute of Singapore</a>. However, the country’s participation
rate has stagnated at 40 percent, a far cry from the ideal rate of 70 percent
at the minimum.&nbsp;With&nbsp;<a href="https://doi.org/10.3322/caac.21660" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">female breast cancer now the leading cancer type</a>&nbsp;worldwide,
much work is urgently needed to enable access to potentially life-saving
medical services. “The goal is to empower women with data-driven, patient-centric
and value-based care,” Li said.</p>
<h4><strong>Adding Genes into the Equation</strong></h4>
<p>Unlike normal cells, cancer cells grow and multiply when they are not
supposed to, even spreading to and wreaking havoc on other sites of the
body. This abnormal behavior often boils down to genetic mutations, which
are changes in one’s DNA that contain instructions for making proteins,
making genetic testing a valuable part of cancer care.</p>
<p>Even before a tumour has formed, genes already hold critical clues to
predicting one’s risk for developing breast cancer. However, cancer’s polygenic
origins, where multiple genes influence the manifestations of disease,
make risk prediction a complex affair. According to Li, even common variants—variations
to disease-causing gene copies that are frequently found in the population—are
individually linked with only a small amount of risk.</p>
<p>By lumping together information from the Breast Cancer Association Consortium,
Li and colleagues created a single polygenic risk score to sum up the effects
of several genes with links to breast cancer. Besides confirming its validity
as a prediction model for Asian populations, their approach also generates
a gradient-like spread that categorises individuals into percentiles based
on their risk scores, effectively distinguishing ultra-high risk and ultra-low
risk groups.</p>
<p>In addition, scientists have been on the hunt for the right combination
of clinically relevant high-risk breast cancer genes. Together with the
breast cancer polygenic risk score, the application of genetic knowledge
to risk stratification will enhance screening accuracy and improve efficiency.</p>
<p>“By adding genetic risk factors into a screening programme, we can identify
many women who would later develop breast cancer yet might otherwise not
be considered high risk,” Li explained.</p>
<h4><strong>A Holistic Approach to Screening</strong></h4>
<p>Beyond genes, breast cancer risk prediction is most effective when it
takes into account non-genetic factors, such as the age at which mothers
had their first child or a woman’s family history. Individuals whose family
members are diagnosed with breast cancer tend to be at higher risk of developing
the disease themselves.</p>
<p>Although genes contain the codes for biological processes, they are not
always switched on, making health and disease much more complicated than
simply arising from genetic factors. Instead, interactions between genes
and the environment help determine whether the faulty gene is activated
and harmful mutations can manifest their effects. Meanwhile, external factors
like lifestyle habits or pollution exposure might influence otherwise normal
genes to go haywire.</p>
<p>While family history is not considered a genetic factor per se, it is
a great way to showcase the role of gene-environment effects. Since close
relatives have similar genetics and are likely exposed to similar external
contexts, encouraging first-degree relatives testing could help expand
screening coverage and crucially reach those likely at risk for breast
cancer.</p>
<h4><strong>Translating Genetics for Precision</strong></h4>
<p>While early detection is the first and a significant step towards saving
lives, information from genes can similarly be a game-changer for the latter
parts of the patient journey. Even with a similar breast cancer diagnosis,
not all tumours are built the same way, requiring different interventions
to disrupt their disastrous effects.</p>
<p>As each tumour’s genetic landscape evolves over time, monitoring these
changes through precision diagnostics is vital for effective clinical care.
Precision diagnostics captures a snapshot of the molecular drivers of tumours,
providing unprecedented insights into cancer progression and drug response.
By analysing potential vulnerabilities or resistances to different therapies,
doctors can select the best possible treatments for patients.</p>
<p>For example, when a gene called HER2 is amplified, excessive copies of
the HER2 protein are produced, helping breast cancer cells evade death
and accelerating tumour progression. While HER2 overexpression leads to
a more aggressive form of breast cancer, these tumours also become more
susceptible to a drug called Herceptin that latches onto the HER2 proteins.</p>
<p>With repetitive testing and better data, patients stand to benefit from
potentially better clinical outcomes and more responsive, adaptable care
along the way. “We hope to increase breast cancer awareness, improve screening
uptake and ultimately change the screening guidelines and save lives,”
Li said.</p>
