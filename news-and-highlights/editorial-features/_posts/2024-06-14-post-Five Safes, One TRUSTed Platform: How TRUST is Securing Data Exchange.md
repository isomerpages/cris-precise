<p>Singapore has ambitious plans for precision medicine—with large-scale
implementation and comprehensive Singaporean genomic databases by 2030.
But before that can happen, large volumes of data must be collated, standardised,
shared and analysed.</p>
<p>TRUST (Trusted Research and Real world-data Utilisation and Sharing Tech)
is Singapore 's national data exchange platform that aims to facilitate
the process—enabling health-related research and anonymised data sharing
between public institutions, as well as between public and private sectors.
But given the immutability and sensitivity of healthcare information such
as genetic sequences and biometrics, how does TRUST facilitate data exchange
while still ensuring its security?</p>
<h4><strong>Adopting the Five Safes</strong></h4>
<p>The team tapped on an established framework. Dr Sue-Ann Lee, Director
(HealthTech Policy Division), Ministry of Health (MOH), explained, “MOH
has already adopted the Five Safes Framework—an internationally recognised
system for organisations to design safeguards around data security and
protection. As TRUST falls under the Ministry’s purview, we naturally extended
the use of Five Safes to TRUST’s data governance.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>But while the Framework is easily applicable to a wide range of purposes,
it still had to be adapted to TRUST’s context. Dr Low Pin Yan, Lead, Planning
&amp; Policy, TRUST Office said, “Within the Framework, there are many
controls—which could be adapted in accordance with TRUST’s objectives.
So for instance, TRUST enables research and drives&nbsp;innovations. This
means that while our controls should ensure the safe and secure use of
data, they shouldn’t perturb data to the point where it loses all utility.”</p>
<h4><strong>Implementing the Five Safes</strong></h4>
<p>Dr Low continued, “That said, the Five Safes should not be seen as merely
a set of controls in place. Instead, it’s a synergistic deployment of many
different measures.”</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Safe Purpose.</strong> TRUST’s
Data Access Committee (DAC) is delegated with the responsibility of reviewing
data requests to see if they fulfil public interest and is assessed to
be of social value as well as comply with data permissions as established
with the data owners. The DAC comprises members from government, research
institutions, healthcare clusters, domain experts from law and ethics as
well as laypersons.</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Safe People. </strong>Only
researchers or employees of partner organisations bound by the TRUST Data
Request Agreement can access data on TRUST. The users will also have to
abide by TRUST’s code of conduct. Internally, TRUST has proper user governance
for the access and processing of data.</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Safe Settings. </strong>TRUST
is hosted on the government commercial cloud with government-standard safeguards.
While TRUST can be accessed remotely via a virtual desktop interface, TRUST
partner organisations ensure that their users log in from a secure environment.
For certain data (e.g. sensitive data), users are required to access TRUST
via certified micro access labs.</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Safe Data.</strong> TRUST
has implemented policies and safeguards to ensure data anonymisation according
to MOH standards. For example, direct and indirect identifiers such as
NRIC, names, and date of birth are anonymised. TRUST also features legal
and technical safeguards on use of its data.</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Safe Output.</strong> Users
are not allowed to extract microlevel data from TRUST—only approved aggregated
analytical output can be downloaded. Research publication drafts using
TRUST data will also be reviewed by TRUST for re-identification risks and
alignment with approved research purposes.</p>
<h4><strong>Safeguarding the Five Safes</strong></h4>
<p>Taken as a whole, the Five Safes Framework requires the cooperation of
multiple parties—TRUST, government, partner institutions, data owners,
researchers—to function well. Yet, studies show that almost nine in 10
data breaches are caused by human error.<a href="#_ftn1" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><sup>[1]</sup></a> With so many parties involved at every
stage of the Framework, how does TRUST intend to circumvent bad actors
and human errors?</p>
<p>Dr Low said, “The Framework doesn’t just rely on one lever to ensure data
safety and security. The multiple measures including policies, legal, and
technology act as a failsafe—and we are constantly working on communicating
best practices to our community to ensure that everyone is on the same
page. But I’m glad that thus far, the research community has been responsive
and is working together to make this happen.”</p>
<p>However, the risk of bad actors still exists. Dr Lee said, “It would be
impossible and impractical to completely eradicate risks. But what we can
do is try to reduce them to the acceptable risk level. So for example,
TRUST uses a combination of controls to ensure that users won’t be able
to exfiltrate data without a great amount of effort. Add to that the contracts
and undertakings placed on organisations and users before they can access
TRUST data—these combined technical and legal controls serve to deter any
unauthorised behaviour.”</p>
<h4><strong>Refining the Five Safes</strong></h4>
<p>Nonetheless, four years since the conceptualisation of TRUST—the team
emphasises that TRUST remains a work-in-progress on multiple fronts. One
such aspect is further strengthening data anonymisation through privacy
enhancing technologies. Dr Lee said, “We are currently actively exploring
homomorphic encryption—in future, users could potentially run analyses
on encrypted data without needing the raw data at all.”</p>
<p>“Adding on to that, we are also looking to better support industry partnerships,”
said Dr Low. “TRUST was only opened up to the wider research community
in end 2022. We are still learning how best to support the ecosystem and
enable public-private partnerships. With feedback from our partners, we
will continue to refine and redefine current measures under the Five Safes
Framework to bring health-related research and real-world data together
to support innovation and improve health outcomes.”</p>
