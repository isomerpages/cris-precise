<h4><em>Including Asian genomes to increase the diversity of genomic databases is the first step towards targeted, more effective clinical approaches to treat and prevent disease.</em></h4>
<hr>
<h4><strong>Investing in Diversity for a Healthier Tomorrow</strong></h4>
<p>The biological blueprints for each one-of-a-kind individual are encoded
in six billion DNA building blocks or base pairs. Given how each person
is unique, it may come as a surprise that we share 99.9 percent of our
genes with the entire human population. The remaining 0.1 percent—roughly
six million base pairs—contain information that could determine our health,
our risk of disease and how we respond to the environment or treatments.</p>
<p>The landscape of human genetic diversity is indeed a rich source of information
for unlocking precision medicine’s full potential. Navigating this landscape,
however, requires the use of maps: large genomic datasets that capture
the full spectrum of this diversity. Only with a sufficiently detailed
map will we be able to translate genetic research safely across different
ethnic backgrounds.</p>
<p>We’re not quite there yet, however, considering that almost half of the
global population is underrepresented in existing databases. To date, Asian
genomes account for only ten percent of all recorded sequences. The divide
is even more pronounced in South Asia which accounts for just one percent
of all genetic data despite comprising 40 percent of the world population.</p>
<p>Hoping to bridge this chasm, the global precision medicine movement is
well underway with a number of large-scale studies focusing specifically
on Asian populations already in motion. To better serve their populations—which
collectively form two thirds of the world’s population—countries across
Asia are embarking on these database-building projects to fill in the much-needed
details of the global genetic map.</p>
<h4><strong>Drugs and Diseases in an Asian Context</strong></h4>
<p>Collecting, analysing and tracking genetic differences has life-saving
potential; from helping design drug screening strategies to illuminating
which patient groups are most at risk for developing certain medical conditions.
Additionally, these genetic insights can help predict how patients are
likely to respond to treatment. For instance, warfarin, a blood thinner
commonly prescribed for cardiovascular conditions, is about four times
more likely to cause adverse reactions in patients of Chinese, Korean,
and Japanese ancestries, suggesting that these patients may require lower
doses of the life-saving drug.</p>
<p>Likewise, lung cancer appears to strike Asians and Europeans differently,
typically afflicting male smokers in European populations but showing up
commonly in non-smokers of East Asian ancestry. One reason for this difference
is that some East Asian lung cancer patients had tumours with much higher
levels of proinflammatory genes, suggesting that East Asian patients could
be treated with drugs targeting the immune system.</p>
<p>Understanding such differences means that doctors won’t have to resort
to using trial-and-error to help their patients in the future. Instead,
by feeding a patient’s DNA sequence into a genetic reference database they
will be guided towards the most effective course of action with the highest
safety margin.</p>
<p>But before patients can begin to experience the benefits of precision
medicine, those reference databases need to be in place. In many of these
database-building endeavours, researchers use state-of-the-art technologies
such as next-generation sequencing and analytical platforms driven by artificial
intelligence. These advances are slashing the time it takes to sequence
and analyse human genomes from decades to days, accelerating discoveries
around the associations between genetics and disease. Additionally, scientists
can explore population structures and migration histories through genetic
data, which can greatly assist in the design of even larger scale studies.</p>
<h4><strong>The Path to Precision</strong></h4>
<p>To date, nearly 40 countries worldwide have kickstarted precision medicine
initiatives. China is positioning itself to be a global leader in the field,
investing over US$9 billion to sample the genomes from its population of
nearly 1.4 billion. Closer to home, Genomics Thailand aims to sequence
the genomes of 50,000 Thais by 2023, adding much needed Southeast Asian
representation to global databases.</p>
<p>Singapore, too, is committed to fast-tracking its citizens’ access to
this new healthcare model. Accordingly, we have established Precision Health
Research Singapore (PRECISE), an organisation that will work hand in hand
with local patients, healthcare providers and government agencies in a
collaborative manner to close the diversity gap around Asian genetics.
Over the next decade, PRECISE will spearhead comprehensive local genomics
studies and, importantly, boost public and industry engagement around precision
medicine.</p>
<p>Centrally located in the heart of Southeast Asia, Singapore is uniquely
suited for this program. The Island City is a melting pot of cultures and
genomic diversity—over 5.8 million residents hailing from a multitude of
regions in both Asia and beyond. The SG100K Project, for example, is an
ambitious undertaking to understand Asia’s 4.5 billion people through the
genomes of 100,000 Singaporeans from the three main ethnicities: Chinese,
Malay and Indian. With this inherent diversity, Singapore is uniquely positioned
to uncover comprehensive genetic insights that may be broadly applied to
these populations.</p>
<p>The project is already yielding results: an earlier phase of the study—which
sequenced the genomes of nearly 5,000 Singaporeans—discovered a whopping
52 million novel genetic variants from these participants alone. Armed
with this data, PRECISE will leverage Singapore’s advanced healthcare information
systems as well as secure, state-of-the-art local computing facilities
to uncover what these variants mean and how they can influence health and
well-being.</p>
<p>Ultimately, expanding the breadth of diversity in genomics for precision
medicine isn’t just about programs and policies—it’s about people. By championing
for education, accountability and transparency, PRECISE aims to promote
inclusivity and lower the barriers to participation. We each hold a distinct
piece of the genetic puzzle, which once complete, can reshape the future
of how we manage and maintain good health.</p>
