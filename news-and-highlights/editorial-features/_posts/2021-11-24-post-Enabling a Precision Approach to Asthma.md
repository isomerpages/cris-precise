<p><em>A discovery revealing the association between a common genetic variation and allergic responses could facilitate precision treatments</em>&nbsp;<em>and better outcomes for asthma.</em>
</p>
<p>As the COVID-19 pandemic threatens to stretch into its third year, most
of us have grown acutely aware of our breathing, with even slight difficulties
in respiration raising alarm bells. But for people with asthma, such awareness
has been a way of life.</p>
<p>Afflicting some 300 million people worldwide1, asthma is the most common
chronic condition of the lungs. But in truth, asthma encompasses many lung
disorders,&nbsp;each with a distinct set of clinical features.&nbsp;Recognising
this diversity, clinicians and researchers have further classified asthma
into subtypes according to the different ways the disease manifests, or
phenotype, and the different pathways that give rise to it, or endotype.
Once classified, treatments can be fine-tuned accordingly, increasing the
chance ofbetter outcomes.&nbsp;Precision medicine pushes this classification
of asthma one step further by also looking at genetic information, while
accounting for&nbsp;medical history and environmental exposures. One such
genetic factor is the presence of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs),
common variations found in DNA sequences that may demarcate regions of
disease relevance.</p>
<h4><strong>The Unusual Suspects</strong></h4>
<p>“Identifying the genes, disease-associated SNPs are associated helps us
understand the mechanism and potential interventions for altering disease,”
said Dr Anand Kumar Andiappan, a Principal Investigator who studies biomarkers
for allergies, infection and respiratory disorders at A*STAR’s&nbsp;
<a href="https://www.a-star.edu.sg/sign" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Singapore Immunology Network (SIgN).</a>
</p>
<p>In a letter2&nbsp;published in&nbsp;<em>The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology</em>,
Andiappan reported the association between a SNP called rs2427837 and the&nbsp;<em>FCER1A</em>&nbsp;gene,
which codes for receptors for IgE, an antibody that mediates allergic responses
in asthma and increases immune reactivity in the airways.&nbsp;To clarify
the role of rs2427837 in asthma severity and potentially find a candidate
gene affecting asthma risk, Andiappan and his colleagues looked at mRNA
data from more than 30,000 blood samples from 30 different cohorts worldwide.
They found a strong and consistent correlation between the rs2427837 SNP
and expression of the&nbsp;<em>FCER1A</em>&nbsp;gene.</p>
<p>“We were able to identify the candidate gene, which may even be a causal
gene, affecting asthma risk,” Andiappan said. To better understand the
SNP’s functional consequences, the research team next looked for the specific
cell types most affected by rs2427837.&nbsp;Analysing the blood samples
at the single-cell level,&nbsp;the team looked for cell types that showed
increases of FCER1A protein levels in relation to&nbsp;rs2427837.</p>
<p>Initially, they expected to find their answer in basophils, a kind of
immune cell that increases in asthmatic airways and allergies. To their
surprise, rs2427837 had no impact on&nbsp;<em>FCER1A</em>&nbsp;expression
in basophils. Instead, the SNP exerted its impact on two other cell types
that weren’t typically implicated in asthma: monocytes, which give rise
to immune cells that attack invading microbes, and plasmacytoid dendritic
cells (pDCs), immune cells which are chiefly involved in the body’s anti-virus
response.</p>
<p>“We believe this has not been reported before although the role of monocytes
and pDCs in asthma has been suggested,” said Andiappan. “Hence, our future
work should look at the immune regulation in these cell types.”</p>
<h4><strong>Asthma’s Balancing Act</strong></h4>
<p>Aside from finding these two new potential players in asthma, the team
also discovered that the rs2427837 SNP affected monocytes and pDCs differently
depending on their genotype.&nbsp;“Genotype refers to the combination of
alleles at a particular position on the DNA,” Andiappan explained. “When
there is a SNP at that position, there are three possible genotype combinations.”
In the case of rs2427837, these are the AA, AG, and GG genotypes.&nbsp;Of
the three genotypes, AA had the strongest effect on monocytes, leading
to exceptionally high levels of the FCER1A protein. In contrast, for pDCs:
the mere presence of the G allele correlated with heightened expression
of&nbsp;<em>FCER1A</em>.</p>
<p>According to Andiappan, the fact that the SNP affects these cells in different
ways reveals the importance of a balanced immune response. If&nbsp;<em>FCER1A</em>&nbsp;expression
is balanced between monocytes and pDCs, as in the case of the AG genotype,
then immune response is well-regulated, and asthma is kept at bay.&nbsp;However,
when GG dominates,&nbsp;<em>FCER1A</em>&nbsp;expression jumps in pDCs,
and the body enters a pro-inflammatory state, leading to the typical symptoms
of asthma, including constricted airways and sustained chronic inflammation.&nbsp;Clarifying
the role of the rs2427837 SNP and&nbsp;<em>FCER1A</em>&nbsp;in asthma—and
how they interact with each other to give rise to the disease—is a big
step toward targeted therapy, but there is still much work left to do.</p>
<p>“Our findings highlight the intricacy of varying&nbsp;<em>FCER1A</em>&nbsp;levels
in different immune cells and their dependency on the genotype of the individual,”
Andiappan said, adding that targeting&nbsp;<em>FCER1A</em>&nbsp;needs to
be done at an individual level, taking account of a patient’s genetic,
disease and physical profiles.&nbsp;While current medical precision still
isn’t at that level, Andiappan is hopeful. As medicine moves away from
the traditional one-size-fits-all therapies,&nbsp;<em>FCER1A</em>&nbsp;may
yet open the doors to treating asthma with precision.</p>
