<hr>
<p>In April 2022, nine-month-old Teddi Shaw was diagnosed with a rare and
deadly metabolic disorder:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.insider.com/toddler-first-uk-to-receive-miracle-drug-rare-fatal-disorder-2023-2" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">metachromatic leukodystrophy</a>,
or MLD. Caused by genetic mutations which gradually damage the protective
layers of nerve cells in the brain and nervous system, it seemed that like
others born with the disease, Teddi would face seizures, the loss of her
senses and mobility, as well as a far shorter life than most infants.</p>
<p>However, just ten months later, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2023/feb/girl-deadly-inherited-condition-cured-ucl-spinout-gene-therapy" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">UK’s University College London</a>&nbsp;announced
that Teddi was disease-free, thanks to a revolutionary gene therapy known
as atidarsagene autotemcel. The faulty genes causing Teddi’s MLD had been
corrected by inserting functional copies of those genes into Teddi’s stem
cells. Her mother declared her a “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2023/feb/15/girl-with-deadly-inherited-condition-mld-cured-gene-therapy-libmeldy-nhs" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">walking, running chatterbox</a>”,
with no signs of disease.</p>
<p>The success of innovative treatments like Teddi’s relies on robust precision
medicine programmes like Singapore’s National Precision Medicine Programme
(NPM), launched in 2017. Designed to accelerate biomedical research and
improve health outcomes, the programme began by generating an extensive
genomic database among Singaporeans in the SG10K_Health&nbsp;project.</p>
<p>Now as the NPM programme enters its second phase, researchers like Assistant
Professor Adrian Teo, Principal Investigator at A*STAR’s Institute of Molecular
and Cell Biology, are working closely with researchers at the National
University of Singapore (NUS)’s Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine to charge
onward. In support of the NPM, the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine has
launched the NUS Precision Medicine&nbsp;<a href="https://medicine.nus.edu.sg/bch/precision-medicine/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Translational Research Program</a>&nbsp;(TRP),
of which Teo and colleagues are a part, to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fdgth.2022.845405/full" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">drive precision medicine for the future</a>.</p>
<h4><strong>Genomic Insights: From Bench to Clinic</strong></h4>
<p>The TRP brings together a multidisciplinary team of experts, including
clinician scientists, geneticists, proteomics scientists and bioinformaticians,
to facilitate the pipeline required for precision medicine programmes.</p>
<p>In this regard, the TRP has three main objectives. The first is to move
from “maps to mechanisms,” or to use human genetics to better understand
and treat diseases. The second is to create human models of disease which
can shed light on physiological changes related to genetic variants of
interest. The third, and perhaps the most ambitious, is to modify the natural
history of disease through novel therapies that can help revolutionise
medicine.</p>
<p>Teo shares that his work revolves around translating genetic and omics
data into clinical applications, identifying and validating novel therapeutic
targets to fully realise the NPM’s goals. For example, biomarkers identified
by omics approaches could provide a way to predict certain diseases at
the population level.</p>
<p>To this end, the TRP is strategically designed around two significant
areas: a central multi-omics programme which generates data from various
omics techniques and genetic analyses, and a complementary mechanistic
design arm which focuses on understanding the molecular mechanisms of various
diseases, including genes and proteins differentially expressed in Asian
populations.</p>
<p>“Many precision medicine programmes are initially focused on sequencing
and omics data collection. At the TRP, we are focused on studying the functions
of genes, proteins, and metabolites that are altered by common genetic
variants that cause disease in Asians,” Teo shared.</p>
<p>The team’s initial area of focus is diabetes and metabolic diseases. “This
is a strong yet niche area at NUS compared to the Singapore NPM programme’s
broader aspects,” explained Teo.</p>
<h4><strong>Roadblocks to Precision Medicine</strong></h4>
<p>Writing in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fdgth.2022.845405/full" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">a perspective article</a>&nbsp;published
in&nbsp;<em>Frontiers in Digital Health</em>&nbsp;in 2022, Teo and other
collaborators identified several challenges to precision medicine programmes
in Singapore and globally. These include ethical issues about trust, personal
identification and security of participants’ data, which can impede large-scale
data collection. To protect participant identity and privacy, the researchers
suggest it is important to provide data de-identification and anonymisation.</p>
<p>However, where participant recruitment is more targeted and linked to
clinical care, data anonymisation may not always be feasible. In these
cases, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning advances may provide
a way to ensure patient privacy via data encryption.</p>
<p>Another important factor for programmes like the NPM is continued access
to more East Asian data. “For precision medicine to be applied effectively
to stratify East Asian populations, large amounts of East Asian genomic
and phenome data are still needed to enable a robust dataset,” explained
Teo.</p>
<p>Beyond that, the standardisation of laboratory methodologies, validation
of biological assays, data analysis approaches and data pipelines also
present other pertinent challenges for the long-term success of national
precision medicine programmes.</p>
<p>For Teo and the team at the TRP, these challenges can be overcome. According
to Teo, it is first important to scale TRP’s data capabilities to make
meaningful contributions to match the large national efforts. “We must
balance this with the limited capacity to conduct the mechanistic work,”
he added.</p>
