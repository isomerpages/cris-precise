<p><em>Precision oncology removes the guesswork in cancer care and allows doctors to tailor treatment to individual patients.</em>
</p>
<p>For every White person of European descent with natural killer T-cell
lymphoma (NKTCL), up to five Asians will be diagnosed with the same disease.</p>
<p>Though aggressive, NKTCL is typically a rare type of cancer, so its unusually
high rates in Asian populations have baffled scientists and doctors for
years. The persistent underrepresentation of Asians in large-scale genetic
studies left this puzzle unsolved—that is until 2020, when researchers
from various countries in Asia conducted the largest genetic study on NKTCL
to date, enrolling more than 20,000 participants, all of East Asian ethnicity.</p>
<p>Because of these efforts, NKTCL has become part of a small but growing
list of cancers that had genetic characteristics unique to Asian populations.
In the same year, at least two other studies published similar findings:
one revealed that lung adenocarcinomas mutated much slower in Asians, while
another discovered gene mutations that made Asian alcohol drinkers more
susceptible to gastric cancer.</p>
<p>Cancer has always been understood as a complicated disease. But as these
studies have shown, the more we learn about it, the depth of its complexity
also becomes more apparent. Soon, a blanket approach to diagnosing and
treating malignancies won’t cut it.&nbsp;To keep up with cancer, the medical
community will need more sophisticated, precise tools.</p>
<p>In this feature, we look at precision oncology as an emerging strategy
that promises more accurate diagnoses and effective treatment—paving the
way for a new paradigm in cancer care.</p>
<h4><strong>Cracking the Cancer Conundrum</strong></h4>
<p>By using molecular profiling techniques to characterise tumours and to
optimise treatment, precision oncology is medicine’s answer to cancer’s
complexity. Though its exact definition has evolved through the years,
precision oncology strategies have always acknowledged the central role
of genetics in the development, progression and management of malignancies.</p>
<p>In fact, genetic analysis is a cornerstone of precision oncology. In some
cancers, the presence or absence of a particular genetic mutation could
indicate its aggressiveness, with many doctors already taking this information
into consideration when delivering diagnoses. However, the true promise
of precision oncology lies in its potential to completely overhaul cancer
treatment.</p>
<p>Currently, malignancies are treated with a ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach.
Chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery are the three main pillars of cancer
treatment and are applied regardless of disease stage or type. While there
is some flexibility, such as foregoing surgery in frail patients or adjusting
drug choice based on allergies, the overall regimen remains rigid.</p>
<p>The result? Inefficient cancer care. Patients and doctors often have to
suffer through a painful trial-and-error phase before they settle on the
most effective treatment regimen, all while racking up healthcare costs
and side effects.</p>
<p>In contrast, precision oncology uses state-the-art technologies to ensure
efficiency. With the help of advanced gene sequencing techniques and powerful
analytics software,&nbsp;doctors can look for genes, proteins and other
similar markers that could reveal key weaknesses and susceptibilities of
the tumour.</p>
<p>This information, in turn, can help them prescribe drugs with a high likelihood
of success. In cases where there are simply no known effective treatments,
doctors can also use biomarker data to enrol their patients into the most
appropriate clinical trial.</p>
<p>Moreover, precision oncology also accounts for the patient’s specific
genetic and molecular profile, allowing doctors to choose medicines that
are unlikely to have heavy side-effects.</p>
<p>In sum, precision oncology harnesses deep molecular data and combines
it with patient information—from their lifestyles and ethnicities to their
medical histories and environmental exposures—to arrive at the optimal
treatment plan.</p>
<h4><strong>The Future is Now</strong></h4>
<p>While precision oncology is touted as the future of cancer medicine, many
cancers are already benefitting from a precision approach.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most prominent example is non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
Traditionally, this malignancy had few treatment options, with most patients
relying on highly toxic platinum-based chemotherapy. But today, precision
oncology dominates clinical decision-making for NSCLC, heavily influencing
treatment choices for up to half of patients and resulting in better outcomes.</p>
<p>Some of the more extensively-studied forms of cancer, like breast cancer
and gastric cancer, have also benefitted from a precision oncology approach
by using markers that have already been identified and validated.</p>
<p>But precision oncology is still very young. Though the list is growing,
there is still only a small number of cancers that benefit from a precision
approach, with drugs that can target these malignancies. In non-White ethnic
groups, basic mutation data can be sparse, making even precision diagnosis
difficult. These gaps will need to be thoroughly addressed before precision
oncology can truly and completely be integrated into clinical practice.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the field is exciting and rapidly evolving. Researchers are
continuously discovering new genetic alterations and biomarkers that could
act as therapeutic targets and developing new technologies to smoothen
the process for patients. As we become equipped with better data and more
advanced techniques, cancer treatment can someday become less daunting—with
the help of precision oncology.</p>
