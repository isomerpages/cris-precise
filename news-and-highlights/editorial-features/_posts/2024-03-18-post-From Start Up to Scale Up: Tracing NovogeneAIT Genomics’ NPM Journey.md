<p>NovogeneAIT Genomics is a local startup—incorporated in December 2016
as a joint venture between Novogene and AITbiotech—to collaborate with
A*STAR’s Genome Institute of Singapore (GIS) in establishing a Whole Genome
Sequencing centre.</p>
<p>The set up of this centre marked a significant milestone, enabling Singapore
to take the lead in large-scale sequencing capability in Asia for the first
time. Moreover, it played a crucial role in supporting important public
research initiatives that have benefited both the Singapore biotech ecosystem
and the wider region.</p>
<h4><strong>What is the involvement of NovogeneAIT Genomics in Singapore’s NPM journey?</strong>&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Before the establishment of NovogeneAIT Genomics, AITbiotech had collaborated
with GIS to offer Next-Generation Sequencing services. This laid the foundation
for the public-private partnership between NovogeneAIT Genomics and GIS
to establish a joint sequencing lab in 2017, and subsequently, NovogeneAIT
Genomics involvement in NPM Phase I.</p>
<p>At that time, we were a young startup with a modest setup. Over time,
we invested in hardware and software, including the upgrade of our Laboratory
Information Management System (LIMS). We also enhanced our team's capabilities
by recruiting the right talent and facilitating knowledge transfer from
our partners. Furthermore, we optimised our laboratory workflows and implemented
automation to increase productivity, while ensuring alignment with our
partners. The journey was challenging, but gradually, we gained momentum
and translated our learnings into best practices.</p>
<p>In 2021, NPM Phase II was launched and we were appointed by Illumina as
the sole sequencing provider to carry out Whole Genome Sequencing for 100,000
consented individuals as part of the PRECISE-SG100K project. Leveraging
our learnings from NPM Phase I and building on strong partnerships with
various research institutions, scientists, and stakeholders, we hit the
ground running within three months.</p>
<p>The scale of Phase II was significantly larger than that of Phase I. To
manage this development, we expanded our team, implemented state-of-the-art
lab automation, established robust training programmes, and offered attractive
career development opportunities to enhance local talent development and
retention.</p>
<p>As of December 2023, PRECISE-SG100K has sequenced 50,000 whole genomes.</p>
<h4><strong>How has NovogeneAIT Genomics’ partnership with NPM benefited Singapore?</strong></h4>
<p>The partnership between NPM and NovogeneAIT Genomics has facilitated the
establishment of a large-scale commercial sequencing facility which supports
the local biotech ecosystem. Prior to the <a href="https://npm.sg/phase-i-sg10k-health/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>SG10K_Health project</u></a> and
the establishment of our sequencing facility, many local research organisations
and universities could only send their samples to GIS or sequencing facilities
in other countries.</p>
<p>The launch of SG10K_Health allowed NovogeneAIT Genomics to expand our
scale and scope of operations, resulting in greater economies of scale.
The partnership with the NPM programme made it cost-efficient to establish
a large-scale commercial sequencing facility, and boost Singapore's capability
to process genomic samples from other countries, strengthening its position
as a regional genomic research hub.</p>
<p>Another significant gain from this collaboration is the development of
human capital. Skilled workforce is crucial for the operation of the sequencing
platform, sample and data management. In the early stages of Singapore’s
precision medicine journey, NovogeneAIT Genomics brought in specialists
from our partners for knowledge transfer and to support our local team.
This technology transfer has proven valuable, with the core team running
the lab today composed mostly of Singaporeans.</p>
<h4><strong>How has the partnership with NPM benefited NovogeneAIT Genomics?</strong></h4>
<p>First, our collaboration with GIS and NPM has allowed us to gain extensive
experience in large-scale Next-Generation Sequencing operations. This has
prompted us to refine our standard operating procedures to align with industry’s
best practices, directly enhancing our overall quality and delivery. The
positive reputation gained from delivering quality work in a landmark project
has fostered trust among prospective customers and partners, constituting
the first dimension of our growth.</p>
<p>Since our involvement in NPM Phase I, NovogeneAIT Genomics has significantly
expanded our market coverage and presence across the Asia Pacific, Middle
East, and Africa (AMEA) region. Our customer base has diversified to include
more than 300 organisations, ranging from neighbouring developing markets
such as Indonesia and Thailand to larger and more mature markets like South
Korea, Japan and Australia.</p>
<p>Ultimately, our customers’ trust in our services serves as an affirmation
of our data quality and reliability. While price is a key determinant for
choosing service providers, researchers also prioritise reliability and
data quality. To address this, we create a robust sample-to-data delivery
workflow and maximise economies of scale. The success of the SG10K_Health
and PRECISE-SG100K projects has allowed us to scale effectively. In fact,
our scale prompted us to establish our own logistics hub and a proprietary
Customer Service System (CSS), enabling customers to easily track their
samples through a user-friendly portal.</p>
<h4><strong>What is on the horizon for NovogeneAIT Genomics?</strong></h4>
<p>We are sincerely grateful and honoured for the opportunity to contribute
to both the SG10K_Health and PRECISE-SG100K projects, and we are enthusiastic
about the prospect of continuing this engagement into the next phase of
NPM. On a business level, our goal is clear—to maintain leadership in the
sequencing field by prioritising cost-effectiveness, enhancing customer
experience, and ensuring the highest level of data quality.</p>
<p>To achieve this, we are committed to invest in several key areas. First
and foremost, we will focus on upskilling our team, ensuring that they
are equipped with the latest knowledge and expertise. Additionally, we
will continue to invest in new and better technology to drive up productivity.
We also have plans to venture into clinical-grade sequencing and explore
new frontiers in omics, such as proteomics.</p>
<p>Concurrently, we are dedicated to contribute towards the development of
next-generation life science and biotech talent. This includes offering
internship placements, sharing knowledge and experiences at universities,
and collaborating with research institutes. By doing so, we aim to not
only stay at the forefront of the industry but also contribute to its continuous
advancement.</p>
