<p>While precision medicine is more frequently associated with adult diseases,
it clearly has a role to play in paediatrics. Dr. Saumya Shekhar Jamuar
who holds concurrent appointments as Senior Consultant, KK Women’s and
Children’s Hospital (KKH), and Deputy Director (Clinical), SingHealth Duke-NUS
Institute of Precision Medicine cannot agree more.</p>
<hr>
<p>Dr. Jamuar plays an active role in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.singhealthdukenus.com.sg/acp/paediatrics/clinical-overview-and-objectives" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Singapore Childhood Undiagnosed Disease Programme—Bringing Research Innovations in Diagnosis of Genetic Diseases in Singapore (BRIDGES)</a>—that
was set up in 2014 by KKH in collaboration with the Agency for Science,
Technology and Research (A*STAR) and Duke-NUS Medical School. It led to
the discovery of the ‘Jamuar Syndrome’. Today, Dr. Jamuar helms the role
of Overall Lead at BRIDGES.</p>
<p>Dr. Jamuar says, “Before next generation sequencing came about, we could
diagnose—maybe—two to four patients a year. With BRIDGES, we are able to
diagnose two to four patients a week. This has helped to better manage
our patients with suspected genetic diseases. While we are able to identify
the aetiology in ~40% of our patients now, there are also others where
we see genetic changes that had never been identified in human diseases.</p>
<p>“One such instance was&nbsp;<a href="/editorial-features/piecing-together-genetic-clues/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_self">this family that has two young girls with various developmental issues</a>.
We couldn’t pin the cause down initially. Eventually, we identified the
genetic change that was actually driving their clinical symptoms—and being
the first person to have discovered it, the syndrome was named ‘Jamuar
Syndrome’. That was significant—not so much because the syndrome is named
after me, but that we found an answer for that family.”</p>
<p><strong>Growing pains in applying precision medicine in diagnosis</strong>
</p>
<p>The question remains. If whole exome sequencing and whole genome sequencing
can improve the yield of primary diagnostic findings in children with suspected
genetic disorders, why are they used as ‘last resort’ tests after a prolonged
diagnostic odyssey<a href="/no-childs-play-in-paediatric-precision-medicine/#_ftnref1" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_self">[1]</a>?</p>
<p>Dr. Jamuar explains, “Globally, paediatric genetic disorders are classified
as rare diseases. But there is increasing realisation that while these
diseases may be rare individually, there are over 7,000 of them collectively.
These disorders manifest in about 2 to 3% of all newborns, and the prevalence
increases to 5 to 6% when they grow up.&nbsp;“One example is familial hypercholesterolemia
where very high cholesterol levels are&nbsp;detected in teenage and young
adult years. This condition increases the risk of a heart attack. Similarly,
the&nbsp;<em>BRCA1</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>BRCA2</em>&nbsp;genes develop
into breast and ovarian cancers when one is in their 30s and 40s.&nbsp;These
findings are starting to change the conversations Surrounding rare diseases—because
we are now understanding their role in common diseases too.”</p>
<p>Dr. Jamuar adds, “And compared to other more known diseases like diabetes,
cancers or heart diseases, whenever someone in the family is diagnosed
with a rare disease, there is often a lot of guilt attached to it like
‘was it something I did or ate that caused this to happen?’. Other times,
patients find it hard to explain their disorders to their families, especially
when they can’t put a name to it.&nbsp;“But this is precisely where genetic
testing comes in. If we can give a name to the condition, we can know for
certain that the condition results from a genetic change that no one has
control over. More importantly, that allows us to ask the next question,
‘What can we do to help them manage or get better?’”</p>
<p><strong>Baby steps towards embracing precision medicine in paediatrics</strong>
</p>
<p>The odds of diagnosing a rare genetic disease have increased over the
years—thanks to next-generation sequencing technology. But more than half
of patients with suspected rare genetic disease remain without a definite
diagnosis<a href="/no-childs-play-in-paediatric-precision-medicine/#_ftnref1" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_self">[2]</a>&nbsp;“Families
of children with undiagnosed genetic diseases often go through a diagnostic
odyssey which involves journeying through multiple doctors, multiple hospitals
and multiple tests before they arrive at an answer. This is a long-drawn
process that takes about 7.6 years on average, and at least two to three
different diagnoses or misdiagnoses,” Dr. Jamuar says.</p>
<p>“Today, next-generation sequencing enables us to find answers to some
of these genetic disorders. But as a scientific community, we are increasingly
probing further to seek out other complementary technologies that can potentially
help us diagnose and treat better with more targeted therapies.</p>
<p>“For instance, a patient with a rare disease called tuberous sclerosis
may present with tumors in the brain and, in the past, the patient would
have to go through multiple surgeries. Now, we can offer targeted therapy
to shrink the tumour. Then there are cases where we can actually prescribe
a gene therapy that can target the non-working gene and change its genetic
configuration back to a normal copy. This is a new and exciting area—and
we can be certain that the body of knowledge and application will expand
in the next decade or so.”</p>
<p><strong>The future of precision medicine in paediatrics and medicine</strong>
</p>
<p>Precision medicine, integrated into healthcare, has the potential to yield
more precise diagnoses, predict disease risk before symptoms occur, and
design customised treatment plans that maximise safety and efficacy.
<a href="/no-childs-play-in-paediatric-precision-medicine/#_ftnref2" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_self">[3]</a>
</p>
<p>Dr. Jamuar says, “Our current clinical narrative goes like this—someone
falls ill, sees the doctor, gets the diagnosis and receives medicine to
manage the symptoms. It is reactive. In contrast, precision medicine is
predictive and preventive. Instead of treating the illness when they manifest
and health has already deteriorated to a certain extent, we pick up the
disorders and institute treatment much earlier. In the process, we gain
the opportunity to possibly change their health trajectory.&nbsp;“But that
is not the only difference precision medicine offers. Besides the patient,
it helps the family who share the same genetic composition to ascertain
and understand their risks. For example, for a young couple planning to
start a family, it helps them to know if their child has a 2%, 25%, or
50% risk of inheriting the disease.</p>
<p>“Foreseeably, precision medicine is what the future of medicine will look
like,” injects Dr. Jamuar.</p>
