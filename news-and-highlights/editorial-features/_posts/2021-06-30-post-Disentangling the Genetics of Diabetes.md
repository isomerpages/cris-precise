<p><em>With several different subtypes, causes and therapies, diagnosing and managing diabetes have become a complicated problem. Precision medicine could hold the answer.</em>
</p>
<p>Diabetes is a serious issue in Singapore, where 400,000 people suffer
from the chronic disease. By 2030, however, that number is set to increase
by 50 percent to 600,0001, driven by changing population demographics.</p>
<p>“Diabetes is an invisible disease,” Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong explained
at the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?ref=external&amp;v=750956588900640" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">launch of the WHO’s Global Diabetes Compact</a>,
in early April 20212. “It does not appear as a top cause of death, but
many heart attacks, strokes and kidney failures in fact trace back to diabetes.”</p>
<p>The diverse impacts of diabetes are especially concerning because it has
no cure. The best way to deal with it is to prevent it from developing
in the first place.</p>
<h4><strong>Not Just about Sugar</strong></h4>
<p>At its most fundamental level, diabetes is simply having too much sugar
in the blood. Because its basic definition is so broad, hundreds of millions
of people the world over have been diagnosed with it. But in truth, the
disease is much more complex, having many different subtypes, each with
their own unique set of causes.</p>
<p>Very rarely, diabetes can be attributed to monogenic mutations—changes
in one single gene that affect the way it works. These subtypes run along
family lines and are passed from parent to child. An example&nbsp;of this
is MODY3—maturity-onset diabetes of the young, which is caused by mutations
to a gene called HNF1A. Almost everyone who inherits these mutations from
their&nbsp;parents will develop MODY3 in their lifetime.</p>
<p>The vast majority of diabetes, on the other hand, arises due to a combination
of various factors. In some cases, the immune system destroys crucial cells
in the pancreas, rendering the body completely unable to make insulin,
the hormone that helps cells convert sugar into energy. This condition
is called Type 1 diabetes.</p>
<p>But most diabetics are still able to produce insulin, just not well enough
to keep up with their diet. This subtype, called Type 2 diabetes, is the
most open to prevention: losing weight, exercising more and cutting calories
all help keep the disease at bay.</p>
<h4><strong>Working through Complexity</strong></h4>
<p>With so many diabetes subtypes to consider and so many factors to look
at, delivering an accurate diagnosis is a herculean task. Thankfully,&nbsp;
<a href="/singapore-s-national-precision-medicine-programme/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_self">precision medicine</a>&nbsp;can help tease apart the complexity of diabetes.</p>
<p>Rather than fixating just on sugar, precision medicine looks at diabetes
holistically. Through&nbsp;traditional laboratory techniques, along with
cutting-edge gene sequencing and computing technologies, doctors can take&nbsp;stock
of a patient’s&nbsp;family history, lifestyle, genetics, diet and blood
chemistry (or any combination of these) to efficiently and accurately identify
a specific diabetes subtype.</p>
<p>For instance, while genetic tests can be used to detect monogenic forms
of diabetes like MODY3, it would be impractical and wasteful to test everyone
for mutations. Instead, looking first at each patient’s background and
clinical profile could reveal who would benefit the most from genetic testing.
Such a pragmatic approach not only translates to more streamlined care
down the line, but also lowers the financial burden for patients.</p>
<p>Precision medicine can also lead to better disease management. Typically,
type 2 diabetes is first treated with a drug called metformin. When that
doesn’t work, doctors have to choose from many different types of medications
that each work in unique ways.</p>
<p>In most cases, there isn’t a clear best choice for treatment, and often,
patients and their physicians will have to go through some form of trial-and-error
before they find the optimal agents to use. But precision medicine can
look at each patient individually—their kidney health, body weight and
genetic profile—and select drugs that would most likely be effective without
causing severe side effects.</p>
<h4><strong>The New Clinical Norm</strong></h4>
<p>In his opening address for the WHO’s Global Diabetes Compact, PM Lee made
clear where the Singaporean government stands. “Tackling diabetes is a
major priority for Singapore,” he said. In a bid to beat the disease, parks
and fitness facilities have sprouted all throughout the island nation,
and regulations around sugary drinks have tightened.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<a href="/singapore-s-national-precision-medicine-programme/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_self">National Precision Medicine (NPM)</a>&nbsp;project
is another frontier in this battle. Singapore recognises the immense value
precision medicine can bring to its hospitals and thus has set lofty goals
for itself. Through a 10-year whole-of-government development roadmap,
its NPM strategy seeks to establish a robust multi-ethnic genomic database
with deep phenotypic characterisation that seeks to eventually fully integrate
genetics in clinical practice.</p>
<p>In the future, precision medicine will be widely adopted and embedded
in clinical pathways as part of Singapore’s journey to transform healthcare
for better outcomes. Diabetes is just one of many diseases that could benefit
from a data-driven precision medicine approach.</p>
