<p>When Singapore launched its National Precision Medicine (NPM) initiative
a decade ago, it was a calculated bet that the nation’s unique genetic
diversity and well-coordinated healthcare system would propel precision
medicine to the next frontier. That bet is now entering a pivotal phase:
proof of scale as precision medicine expands from healthy cohorts to diverse
patient populations.</p>
<p>“The question is no longer whether precision medicine can generate insights,
but whether those insights can be translated into real-world patient outcomes,
sustainably and equitably,” says Professor Patrick Tan, Executive Director
of Precision Health Research, Singapore (PRECISE).</p>
<p><strong>Building on a strong foundation</strong>
</p>
<p>The journey began with<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"> </a>
<a href="https://www.npm.sg/news-and-events/editorial-features/sg10k-discoveries-from-mapping-10000-genomes/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Phase I</a><a href="#_msocom_1" class="msocomanchor" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">[SS1]</a>&nbsp;, a proof of concept stage that delivered
Southeast Asia’s first large-scale genetic reference panel. This was more
than just a research achievement; it established the foundational datasets,
sequencing expertise, and governance frameworks necessary to conduct precision
medicine responsibly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Phase II upped the ante on complexity, not only analysing the genetic
information of 100,000 individuals but integrating that data with non-genetic
information like electronic health records, lifestyle information, and
environmental factors. It was a deliberate step toward reflecting the multifaceted
nature of human health, where genes interact with life experiences and
clinical histories.</p>
