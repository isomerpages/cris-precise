<p><em>The largest meta-analysis of people of East Asian origin to date is adding to a growing genetics resource on type 2 diabetes and bolstering precision medicine efforts in the region.</em>
</p>
<p>In the early 20th&nbsp;century, diabetes was a death sentence, leaving
sufferers an average of just one year to live. But in 1921, the discovery
of insulin, the hormone that helps cells turn sugar into energy, turned
this fatal disease into a manageable one.</p>
<p>Yet, one century later, diabetes is posing new challenges. Type 2 diabetes,
a particular type linked to obesity and insulin resistance, has risen to
epidemic proportions—with cases more than tripling worldwide over the past
20 years[1]. This explosion in cases is revealing striking disparities
in risk, especially between Asian and Caucasian populations. Not only are
East Asian individuals more likely to develop type 2 diabetes, but they
do so at a lower body mass index (BMI) than their European counterparts.</p>
<p>To understand and combat these emerging trends, scientists are turning
to genetics. While Asian genetics studies have historically lagged behind
those in Europe, they have started catching up over the past decade.</p>
<p>In 2020, a collaboration by 113 scientists combined data from 23 cohort
studies from the Asian Genetic Epidemiology Network, a decade-old consortium
of genetic studies of type 2 diabetes in East Asia, to perform the largest
meta-analysis of East Asian individuals to date [2]. The study, published
in&nbsp;<em>Nature</em>, compares the genetic risk of type 2 diabetes between
East Asian and European populations.</p>
<p>“Studying East Asian individuals at such an unprecedented collaborative
scale allows us to expand the number of genetic variants associated with
diabetes to understand population differences in the development of type
2 diabetes,” said corresponding author Xueling Sim, Assistant Professor
at the National University of Singapore’s Saw Swee Hock School of Public
Health.</p>
<p><strong>Small changes, big impact</strong>
</p>
<p>At our core, humans are more similar than we are different. The genome
of all humans, for instance, contains about three billion base pairs and
20,000 protein-coding genes. While we all harbour genetic variants, or
changes in the sequences of our genes, that make us unique, these account
for just 0.001 percent of our DNA.</p>
<p>The similarity in our genomes appears to extend somewhat to our genetic
susceptibility to type 2 diabetes. When Sim and colleagues compared genetic
variants that were present in both people of East Asian and European origin,
they found that the effect size, or the link between these variants and
type 2 diabetes, was very similar, indicating that the two populations
had a substantial shared genetic susceptibility to the disease.</p>
<p>However, it turns out that some variants have different effects in different
populations. When there were large differences in effect sizes, the variants
involved were often rare in Europeans but common or present at low frequency
in people of East Asian origin.</p>
<p>“While East Asian individuals share some similar genetic susceptibility,
certain genetic variants predisposing to type 2 diabetes risk have arisen
and occur at higher frequency in East Asian individuals that are very rare
in Europeans,” Sim explained. This highlights the importance of studying
diverse populations so as to better understand the cause of the disease.</p>
<p><strong>A growing resource</strong>
</p>
<p>Aside from comparing common variants, the researchers took advantage of
their large-scale study—which included 433,540 East Asian individuals from
China, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan and USA—to
look for unique genetic links to type 2 diabetes in East Asian people.
They found 61 novel regions of the genome, known as loci, associated with
the disease that had never before been reported in Europeans.</p>
<p>Among the new variants was a pair located in two nearby genes involved
in glucose uptake in skeletal muscle and pancreatic cell development. What
struck the researchers about these variants was that while they were located
in the same locus, the&nbsp;<em>ANK1/NKX6-3</em>&nbsp;locus, these two
variants appear to act via genes with distinct functions in different tissues
of the body. This, according to Sim, tells us that the underlying biology
of type 2 diabetes may be more complex than we think.</p>
<p>The study also provides insight into the intriguing link between BMI and
type 2 diabetes in East Asian individuals. When they accounted for BMI,
the researchers discovered that there were associations between type 2
diabetes and loci found only in East Asian populations linked to body fat
distribution and lipodystrophy, a dysfunction in the way the body uses
and stores fat. These associations may explain why East Asian people develop
the disease even at lower BMIs.</p>
<p>“These results serve as a valuable public resource for precision medicine
efforts in diabetes,” Sim said. Not only will these data be useful for
developing early risk stratification strategies, they will also form the
foundations upon which researchers can discover new pathways and develop
novel drugs to combat the challenges posed by type 2 diabetes in the 21st&nbsp;century.</p>
