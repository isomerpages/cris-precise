<p><em>Based on a projected prevalence of one in 200 to 300, Singapore has about 22,000 cases of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH)1,2,3. However, there is no telling what the real disease frequency is—due to underdiagnosis and undertreatment.</em>
</p>
<p>FH is a silent killer. Globally, only about 1% of the approximately 25
million individuals with FH are diagnosed4. Therefore, it is not unusual
for someone who appears healthy and at low risk of traditional cardiovascular
disease to discover their condition only when a catastrophic cardiovascular
event happens.</p>
<p>Truth is, having FH doesn’t necessarily predict a deadly or devastating
outcome if detected and treated early—because effective pharmacological
therapies are available. They can significantly reduce low density lipoproteins
cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and prevent cardiovascular disease development.</p>
<p><strong>The case for genetic testing</strong>
</p>
<p>“Most doctors are familiar with FH clinical diagnostic criteria such as
the Simon Broome Diagnostic Criteria and the Dutch Lipid Clinic Network
Criteria. However, the application of these involves taking a number of
steps to arrive at a score. The score helps to identify patients with clinical
FH which can be confirmed by genetic testing. Those with confirmed diagnosis
by genetic testing will then be asked to refer their immediate family members
for testing as these family members have a 50% chance of having FH too,”
said Associate Professor Tavintharan Subramaniam, Senior Consultant, Department
of Medicine, Khoo Teck Puat Hospital (KTPH).</p>
<p>Add to that, genetic testing was not available in Singapore as a clinical
standard of care before the rollout of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ktph.com.sg/healthprofessionals/Pages/clinical-research-highlights-publications.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">FHCARE</a> programme at
KTPH. A/Prof Tavintharan explained, “We first started offering genetic
testing as a means of FH diagnosis in 2015. In the beginning, we focused
on referrals with high cholesterol levels from lipid clinics in KTPH. That
allowed us to build up capabilities and confidence in genetic testing.
Since then, we have gained good traction to garner quite a bit of interest
and support among clinicians both within our institution and beyond.”</p>
<p>To date, the FHCARE team has diagnosed over 1,000 FH cases.</p>
<p>Associate Professor Wee Hwee Lin, Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health,
National University of Singapore, said, “But let’s not forget that this
number is only a fraction of the actual number of persons with FH in Singapore.”</p>
<p>A/Prof Wee continued, “There’s no question about it—if we were to provide
support for all FH patients, we’ll need to scale up our existing system
in a sustainable and cost efficient manner. This goes beyond the specialists
to include FH coordinators and even family physicians in the primary care
network. With the clinical implementation pilot under PRECISE, we want
to address how we can do that without burdening the healthcare system.”</p>
<p><strong>The push for cascade screening</strong>
</p>
<p>Familial hypercholesterolemia is a genetic condition that is passed down
in families. Hence, identifying and diagnosing the proband—the first person
to be diagnosed with FH in a family is just the beginning. Family cascade
screening is essential to enable early identification, diagnosis and intervention.</p>
<p>“As important as cascade screening is, only about 40 to 50% of my patients
with confirmed FH genetic diagnosis agree to bring their family members
for genetic testing. While this is a significant improvement over the less
than 10% when we first started, we will need to improve this number further
to be effective,” A/Prof Tavintharan shared. Cascade screening is key to
avoiding delay in diagnosis—allowing opportunity for early, effective and
preventive treatment.</p>
<p>For that to happen, a few challenges need to be addressed first. The lack
of a standardised cascade screening programme in the current clinic setup
means that probands mostly remain uninitiated about the potential disease
risk of their family members. But even when they are aware, family dynamics
could pose barriers for communication with their family members. As a result,
acceptance rates for cascade screening are impacted.</p>
<p>A/Prof Tavinatharan said, “The good news is we are changing the conversation
surrounding cascade screening with a&nbsp;<a href="/clinical-implementation-pilot/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_self">clinical implementation pilot</a>.
With the support of PRECISE, we have established partnership with an accredited
sequencing partner locally. We hope the faster turnaround of reports, plus
the 150-day window for first-degree family members to get free testing,
will make family members of probands more receptive to come forward for
cascade screening.”</p>
<p><strong>A sustainable effort in navigating FH challenges</strong>
</p>
<p>“Indeed, we have made some good headway with the pilot. Over the past
few months, we have engaged clinicians in meaningful discussions on support
needed for scaling up the pilot. We are also very encouraged by the good
recruitment rates—which is a good motivation for us to expedite the establishment
of data sharing agreements and ramp up manpower, for instance,” A/Prof
Wee said.</p>
<p>“Next, we are exploring to leverage technology for scaling up. Can we
use an algorithm to screen people in the electronic medical records system
but who are not in our clinics and may not have considered that their high
lipid levels at a young age is potentially problematic? This widens our
reach to more people who are potentially at risk of having FH with minimal
manpower. Separately, we are also looking to use technology to facilitate
conversations around cascade screening.”</p>
<p>A/Prof Tavintharan said, “Ultimately, FH can be readily treated and is
easily detected. But it all starts with better awareness and education
around FH, and for probands and cascades to come forward and accept treatment
early. Together, we can work towards delaying or even preventing the onset
of coronary diseases.”</p>
