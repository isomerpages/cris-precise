<p>Speaking at the PRECISE-IHCC Conference, jointly organised by Precision
Health Research, Singapore (PRECISE) and the International Health Cohorts
Consortium (IHCC), Professor Julian Savulescu, Chen Su Lan Centennial Professor
in Medical Ethics and Director for the Centre for Biomedical Ethics at
the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore (NUS
Medicine) posed the following question to his audience, “How likely are
you to use embryo selection services, gene editing or SAT preparation courses
to increase the chances that your child would be able to attend a top college?”
&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Ethics is Subjected to Cultural Bias</strong></h4>
<p>A replication of a similar research conducted in the USA, the results
from the Singapore study showed that Singaporeans are not only more willing
to send their children to SAT preparation courses, they were also more
willing to use embryo selection and gene editing services if it could improve
their child’s chance of attending a top college. Sharing the results from
a recently completed research, Prof Savulescu noted that there is a different
level of enthusiasm and receptivity towards gene-based technologies in
Singapore compared to the USA, which appeared to be influenced by ethnicity,
religions and monthly household income.</p>

<p>More than an inquiry into the public’s attitudes towards gene-based technologies,
the presentation also revisited the long-standing debate about eugenics.
Briefly outlining ethical issues such as discrimination, social (in)justice
when costs are prohibitive, and the ethical obligation for parents to want
the best life for their child, Prof Savulescu invited the audience to deliberate
on what would be a good model to regulate gene-based technologies from
a policy standpoint without impeding scientific innovation, and whether
these technologies should be made available only for disease traits or
also for behavioural ones. He pointed out the possible impact disruptive
behavioural traits, such as antisocial personality, have on society and
how they could benefit from gene-based interventions.</p>
<h4><strong>Trust Building Beyond Ethics Compliance</strong></h4>

<p>Notably, gene-based technologies will continue to advance apace regardless
of regulations. Dr Michaela Th. Mayrhofer, Head of ELSI, BBMRI-ERIC reminded
that even in the absence of formal/clear regulations, ethics should not
be forgotten. She went on to give examples of the different forms ethics
can take—formalised guidelines provided by ethics committees, governance
structures enforced by data protection and compliance officers, and even
informal guidance on ethics from an experienced colleague as well as the
work done in research and care. She said “Ethics work is often unseen but
takes place every day and is a cornerstone for building and maintaining
trust in research and medical care. It is relational and calls for everyone
to go beyond mere ethics compliance, which can be perceived as an administrative
effort. Ethics needs to be lived.”</p>
<p>Sharing Prof Savulescu’s views about the complexity of navigating the
ethics landscape, she explained that it could prove challenging for a single
person to effectively oversee the spectrum of ethics considerations. She
said, “There are many moving parts in any scientific research—so one can
always expect to engage with a plurality of ethics experts to ensure ELSI
alignment. But it is noted that no amount of regulations and ethics experts
can replace trust as it is the foundation for compliance with ethical guidelines
and regulations.</p>
<h4><strong>The Importance of Giving Underrepresented Populations a Voice</strong></h4>
<p>Precision medicine marks a revolutionary shift from the conventional approach
to diagnosis and treatment. Integrating genetics, lifestyle and environmental
factors to provide targeted treatment for patients, precision medicine
has the potential to improve population health through disease prevention
and early intervention. Amid this optimism, however, there are concerns
about data privacy and security, equitable access to precision medicine,
and the possibility of stigmatisation and discrimination based on genetic
information.<a href="#_ftn1" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">[1]</a> These
issues pose significant challenges to the advancement of the field—particularly
in achieving equitable understanding of the genetics of underrepresented
and marginalised populations.</p>

<p>Associate Professor Angela Ballantyne, University of Otago, said, “There
is a global sense of urgency in ensuring that our genomic databases accurately
represent different populations and their subgroups. Yet, the reality is
that we are still seeing marginalised and discriminated low-trust groups
participating at lower rates. And if we think we can simply scoop up these
groups that we haven’t brought along with us later—we would be remiss.”</p>
<p>There is a wealth of information embedded within the genomes of different
populations—some of which hold the answer to why people from certain demographics
have a genetic predisposition towards certain diseases. That is why diversity
is essential, from research participation to recruitment—only then can
all people, including those from marginalised and underrepresented populations,
truly benefit from scientific advancement and the full potential of genomics.</p>
<p>“We need to understand that achieving genomic and scientific diversity
in biobanks can only exist within a political and sociocultural context
that fosters trust. Therefore, being transparent and taking time to build
relationships with donors and communities and demonstrating trustworthiness
are often more important than ‘pitching’ about the benefits of genomic
research—because the latter may not be so immediately relatable,” A/Prof
Ballantyne explained.</p>
<p>Using Singapore’s National Precision Medicine (NPM) programme as an example,
she shared that only 64% of respondents expressed willingness to share
their genetic data when a preliminary survey was conducted in 2020.<a href="#_ftn2" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">[2]</a> Three years later,
83% expressed willingness to contribute data to NPM. She explained this
shift as the difference between being able to trust a known entity, governed
by real people, and being asked to trust an abstract idea. She also recognised
the conscientious effort made by the Singapore government to build trust
by engaging people in ongoing conversations about precision medicine. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Ethics Is an Ongoing Work-in-Progress</strong></h4>
<p>When rounding up her talk, Dr Mayrhofer encouraged everyone to not make
transparency, trust, research integrity and science communication as afterthoughts.
Instead, they should be built into the design of the research and regularly
reviewed and updated until the project is finished.<a href="#_ftn3" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">[3]</a> She said, “In this dynamic environment where knowledge
and technology are continuously evolving, everyone involved in the project
should be equally responsible to ensure ethical practice—whether someone
is watching or not—because we all have a part to play and ethics needs
to be lived every day.”</p>

<p>This is the first of a three-part PRECISE-IHCC conference series. Themed
“From Cohorts to Clinics: The New Landscape of Global Healthcare”, the
conference held from 21 to 23 August 2024 in Singapore covered 17 topics
in precision medicine, and sought to address challenges and opportunities
in translating advances into tangible enhancements in patient care to reshape
the landscape of modern healthcare.</p>
