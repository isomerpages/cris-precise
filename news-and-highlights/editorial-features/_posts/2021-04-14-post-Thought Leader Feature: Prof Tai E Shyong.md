<h3><strong>Making Precision Medicine Mainstream</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Precision medicine is already impacting patients’ lives and could help
doctors do more for their patients, says PRECISE’s Chief Medical Officer,
Professor Tai E Shyong.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>Think about the last time you visited your doctor. You probably sat down
and told her about your symptoms, had a quick physical examination and—if
there was time—told her a bit about your habits like whether you smoke
or if you have been eating well. Based on that ten-minute consultation,
your doctor would have to diagnose you and prescribe some medicine, which
in all likelihood would be the same as the last patient with similar symptoms.</p>
<p>But what if your doctor could have spent those ten minutes finding out
more about your overall health concerns instead? Or discussing the implications
of a genetic test that you just took and what it means for your health?
Precision medicine is not just about getting more accurate diagnoses and
drugs that would be both safer and more effective for you, but also an
opportunity to re-think the patient-physician relationship, said Professor
Tai E Shyong, Chief Medical Officer of PRECISE.</p>
<p>Tai, a clinician-scientist specialising in metabolic disorders, shares
how precision medicine is already making a difference in the lives of patients
and how he hopes it can help Singapore future-proof its healthcare system.</p>
<h4><strong>1. Could you give us an example of how precision medicine has helped patients avoid serious side effects?</strong></h4>
<p>There is a drug called carbamazepine that is used to treat epilepsy. Although
it is largely safe, some people who take carbamazepine develop a very severe
skin reaction that is almost like a burn affecting the whole body. In fact,
some people end up dying from this complication.</p>
<p>Recently, researchers discovered that a gene called HLA-B*1502 encodes
susceptibility to this side effect, which means that if you carry this
particular variant, you are at 180 times higher risk of developing this
severe reaction than if you didn’t have this genetic variant. Because of
the very high risk of adverse reactions to carbamazepine and the relatively
high frequency of the HLA-B*1502 variant in Singapore, a study by Duke-NUS
health economist Professor Eric Finkelstein found that testing patients
for the variant before giving them the drug is cost effective. On the basis
of this data, the Health Sciences Authority recommended that everyone in
Singapore who is prescribed this drug should first be tested for this variant.
After testing was introduced in 2014, the number of cases of severe side
effects went down to almost zero.</p>
<h4><strong>2. How can precision medicine improve the way diseases are diagnosed and drugs developed?</strong></h4>
<p>In addition to helping us reduce side effects, precision medicine could
also help patients go from diagnosis to treatment, particularly in the
case of rare inherited diseases. The word ‘rare’ is actually a misnomer
because while each individual disease is rare, about 5-10 percent of the
population suffers from one of these inherited diseases. Most of these
patients are children, who may undergo many tests over the years while
trying to get a diagnosis. Very often, there is no treatment available
even after the diagnosis is made.</p>
<p>How can precision medicine help this? First of all, if it is an inherited
disease, there will be something in the genome you can measure to make
the diagnosis in the first place. But it doesn’t stop there. Once you know
what the genetic defect is, you can develop drugs to correct it, as has
happened in the case of cystic fibrosis. So genetics doesn’t just allow
you to diagnose disorders but actually allows you to develop new therapies.</p>
<h4><strong>3. Your expertise is in metabolic disorders and cardiovascular disease. How is precision medicine transforming the way these chronic diseases are managed?</strong></h4>
<p>Similar to other developed countries, heart disease and stroke is the
leading cause of death in Singapore, accounting for 30 percent of all deaths
in 2019. While preventative lifestyle interventions are important, effective
treatments are also available. The trouble is that they are not always
given to the patients that need them.</p>
<p>Take for example the case of familial hypercholesterolemia, an inherited
condition that increases the levels of cholesterol in the blood such that
people with this genetic defect have very high levels of cholesterol and
are 20 times more likely to develop heart diseases. However, if you can
diagnose the disease early and start patients on cholesterol-lowering treatments,
you can return the life expectancy of these individuals almost back to
normal.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, for most of these people—we think that there are probably
20,000 of them in Singapore alone—remain undiagnosed. However, sequencing
the entire population to identify those individuals is a very expensive
endeavour. One approach may be to screen family members of those known
to carry a genetic variant that causes familial hypercholesterolemia. The
best way to do this—and the impact it could have at the population level—is
still unclear. At PRECISE, we will be working with clinicians in Singapore
to identify the best way to get treatment to those who need it most. This
way, we might reduce the overall burden of heart disease in the future.</p>
<h4><strong>4. Why is it important for Singapore to pursue precision medicine?</strong></h4>
<p>When we participate in precision medicine or any other kind of health
research, we are ultimately trying to change the way medicine is practiced.
In countries that spend very little on healthcare, a small amount of spending
results in a large increase in health. However, these gains plateau off
as you get to developed countries, where you find that governments spend
more and more on healthcare without much gain in health. Part of the reason
for this is that the way we practice medicine today is imperfect, so trying
to do more of the same thing doesn’t necessarily give rise to better health.</p>
<p>One imperfection lies in the fact that family history only scratches the
surface of the genetic component, which can explain up to 30 percent of
health and disease. Given that we can now sequence the entire genome at
lower and lower cost, precision medicine promises to uncover the precise
genetic contribution to disease and allows us to determine the appropriate
treatment more accurately.</p>
<p>The challenge, however, is that the quantity of information to be processed
is vast and cannot be easily handled in the clinic during a traditional
consultation. As such, we must also find ways to summarise this data into
a form that doctors and patients understand, ultimately allowing them to
make decisions based on this information.</p>
<p>Another benefit of using technology in this way is that it could allow
doctors to use their time in the clinic to more fully understand a patient’s
concerns. Instead of having to guess a patient’s genetic susceptibility
from imprecise interviews, doctors can instead focus on giving preventative
advice informed by each patient’s genetic background, lifestyle and environment.</p>
<p>Precision medicine won’t solve all the problems in healthcare, but the
hope is that we can do better than the trial-and-error approach and create
a more efficient healthcare system that meets patients’ needs.</p>
