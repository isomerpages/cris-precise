<p><em>Among adults and children with primary glomerular diseases, about 14-26%[1]&nbsp;are due to genetic causes. But because genetic testing is not part of the routine diagnostic evaluation for primary glomerular diseases locally, patients with genetic causes are often misdiagnosed or diagnosed late.</em>

<p>As a clinician, Associate Professor Ng Kar Hui, Paediatrics Nephrology,
Dialysis and Renal Transplantation, National University Hospital, is in
a good position to change the trajectory of her patients. For example,
the timely detection of coenzyme Q10 deficiency (a genetic condition) in
one of her 10-year-old patients significantly delayed the deterioration
of his kidney function. For another patient, her decisive recommendation
for genetic testing and cascade screening enabled the family to identify
Alport Syndrome as the underlying cause, and for appropriate treatment
to be instituted.</p>
<p><strong>Taking First Steps towards Realising Opportunities</strong>
</p>
<p>“Yes, I can help my patients—but there are other patients in Singapore
who also need help but are not getting them. Therefore, I was naturally
very interested when I came to know about the&nbsp;<a href="/clinical-implementation-pilot/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Clinical Implementation Pilots</a>&nbsp;(CIP)
funded by PRECISE. I saw an opportunity to positively impact treatment
for many more patients with primary glomerular diseases, their families
and alter existing practices around genetic testing,” says A/Prof Ng.</p>
<p>As economic analysis is an integral component in the CIP, A/Prof Ng decided
to approach Professor David Matchar, Programme in Health Services and Systems
Research, Duke-NUS Medical School for a collaboration. She smiles, “I didn’t
know David before this—so I sent him a cold email to arrange for a meet
up. It turned out to be a very fruitful two-hour virtual discussion. Unexpectedly
intensive, but it also brought clarity to what we needed to do.”</p>
<p>Prof Matchar recalls, “For me, I don’t remember much about the specifics
of our conversation. But I definitely remember being impressed with Kar
Hui, and what she wanted to achieve with the CIP. During that call, I realised
for the first time how common Alport Syndrome is, and how we could significantly
reduce the risk of progression to end-stage kidney disease with the use
of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. And the fact that there is
a gap in the current system in Singapore also reaffirmed the fact that
this is a good area to focus on.”</p>
<p>That marked the beginning of the two-year CIP across multiple sites and
involving various Co-Principal Investigators (PIs)—Associate Professor
Jason Choo, Dr Lim Ru Sin, Dr Chan Gek Cher and Dr Esther Leow—and their
teams.</p>
<p><strong>Building Interest within the Healthcare Community</strong>
</p>
<p>Although the utility of genetic testing in primary glomerular diseases
has long been established in many international studies, it is seldom implemented
in the local clinical settings. This CIP is unique in that it aims to clinically
implement genetic testing in the local context, working through issues
like capacity building, work processes, cost effectiveness and genetic
literacy.</p>
<p>“This clinical implementation project for kidney disease is the first
of its kind in Singapore. Its extensive scope meant that we had to get
in touch and speak to geneticists, bioinformaticians,&nbsp;paediatricians,
adult nephrologists, clinic managers, hospital laboratory staff, scientists—pretty
much everyone. Because of this, we generated strong interest in genetics
amongst the kidney specialist doctors. This is an achievement for us,”
A/Prof Ng says. “However, we are also mindful that this gain can quickly
be lost if it is not sustainable and scalable.”</p>
<p>Prof Matchar says, “That’s right—it goes beyond talking to people to keep
the conversation going. We need to ensure that genetic testing is accessible.
That translates into having sufficient genetic experts such as genetic
counsellors and clinicians familiar with genetics. In addition, workflows
surrounding patient education, referrals and consent have to be streamlined
to reduce manpower costs.”</p>
<p>A/Prof Ng elaborates, “Then there is the need to have local accredited
genetic testing laboratories. Local laboratories will allow faster turnaround
time for test results, ideally around two weeks. In glomerular diseases,
a timely genetic result is essential for clinical management to be altered
in time—whether it is avoiding invasive procedures like kidney biopsy or
starting targeted treatment strategies such as more aggressive immunosuppressants
for the non-genetic cases. Genetic conditions generally do not respond
well to immunosuppression. But without genetic results, doctors will empirically
start aggressive immunosuppression as a trial of treatment.” Prof Matchar
carries on, “If I may add, we can also look to cost savings while avoiding
detrimental side effects of immunosuppressants like infections, malignancy
and infertility.”</p>
<p>Prof Matchar continues, “There is a silver lining to all the work that
we are currently doing. We may be laying the foundation for genetic testing
for primary glomerular disease—but let’s not forget that there are many
other diseases that could also benefit from genetic testing. And the infrastructure
that we are establishing now will be the prototype for these other diseases.”</p>
<p><strong>Advocating Genetic Testing among Patients and their Families</strong>
</p>
<p>The lack of a standard workflow is one of the reasons why genetic testing
is not commonly or consistently offered to patients with primary glomerular
disease. However, when it is offered to patients, they are not always receptive
too. A/Prof Ng explains, “Cost is one key consideration for patients. This
goes beyond the immediate cost of genetic testing—they are also concerned
that the test results may affect their insurability, and ultimately, the
burden of future medical costs.”</p>
<p>A/Prof Ng continues, “With this CIP, we hope to find solutions to these
challenges as well as show solid evidence that genetic testing can be a
good diagnostic tool for selected primary glomerular diseases. With early
diagnosis and prompt treatment, the onset of late-stage kidney disease
needing dialysis or transplant can be delayed by as much as two to four
decades.”</p>
<p>“In the bigger context, we are thinking ahead to explore how we can add
to the genetic testing services, like chatbots, educational videos, etc.,”
adds A/Prof Ng. “Today, we are building an ecosystem for our future generations
of nephrologists and patients.”</p>
