<p><em>Patient-empowering approaches like genetic counselling could help usher in the era of precision oncogenomics, say experts at the inaugural Hereditary Cancer Symposium organised by Tan Tock Seng Hospital.</em>
</p>
<p>Prevention is better than cure. That may be a commonly heard refrain and
one that seems to embody the very concept of genetic counselling: using
genetic tests to screen an individual’s genetic makeup for health risks.
But genetic counselling encompasses far more than just prevention.&nbsp;Genetic
counsellors can also use genetic information to determine the best treatment
options for highly variable diseases like cancer while providing much-needed
support for patients, something that has been practised at Tan Tock Seng
Hospital (TTSH) since December 2017.</p>
<p>TTSH’s genetic counselling service first began with a focus on supporting
medical oncology, seeking to empower cancer patients and at-risk individuals
to make more informed choices. This service expanded to a full-fledged
Cancer Genetics and Genomics Clinic in January 2020 but delayed its official
launch to 22 October 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<h4><strong>From Diagnostics to Treatment</strong></h4>
<p>At the inaugural Hereditary Cancer Symposium commemorating the clinic’s
official opening, leading scientists and physicians highlighted that the
complex nature of cancer requires a holistic, detailed approach to improve
prevention, early detection and treatment.&nbsp;After all, how rapidly
a tumour grows and spreads is influenced by a myriad of factors, from DNA
mutations to external risks like pollution exposure. Besides biological
and environmental factors, some tumours may be more or less vulnerable
to certain drugs than others.</p>
<p>Given this variability even amongst patients of the same cancer type,
analysing relevant patient data is key to drawing the links between the
array of tumour drivers and treatment effectiveness. A precision medicine
(PM) approach that curates genetics, medical history, behavioral and environmental
information can therefore guide clinical decision-making to tailor interventions
amid such complexity.&nbsp;“This information enables doctors and healthcare
professionals to better predict patients’ disease risks and improve accuracy
in diagnosis and prescribing treatment,” explained Adjunct Associate Professor
Chong Yew Lam of TTSH in his introduction to the symposium.</p>
<h4><strong>Enabling through Counselling</strong></h4>
<p>From disease prevention to remission, clinical genetics services such
as genetic counselling are emerging as a critical pillar for ushering in
the era of PM. But while genetic testing gathers valuable genetic information
for PM efforts, such initiatives also depend on another crucial aspect:
genetic counselling.</p>
<p>Whether to accelerate research or transition to clinical implementation,
the promise of PM can only be fulfilled by mapping thousands upon thousands
of individuals’ genetic information. Because of the inherently sensitive
nature of this massive undertaking, initiatives like genetic counselling
that provide specialized information to individuals are an instrumental
facet of PM adoption.</p>
<p>By helping individuals understand the risks and potential benefits of
using genetics for clinical management, these counselling services can
overcome barriers like stigma and lack of awareness, ideally leading to
the increased uptake of genetic screening.</p>
<p>After testing, genetic counselling also plays an important role in supporting
patients as they seek to make sense of their results. Equipped with relevant
knowledge about their genetic data and clinical histories, individuals
can take better steps towards prevention, such as changing lifestyle habits.
The information provided by counselling can also help patients feel empowered
in living with their conditions and corresponding treatments.</p>
<p>“This service has improved treatment options for patients and has enabled
early cancer detection through appropriate cancer screening,” shared Adjunct
Assistant Professor Jens Samol, Senior Consultant in Medical Oncology.</p>
<p>Adjunct Assistant Professor Samol, who has headed the&nbsp;Cancer Genetics
and Genomics Clinic since its inception in December 2017, added that&nbsp;genetic
counselling aims to fulfill TTSH’s vision of adding years of healthy life.</p>
<h4><strong>A Future of Precision Healthcare</strong></h4>
<p>For Singapore’s ageing population, deploying genetic testing and PM on
a national scale could be a turning point for tackling chronic diseases.
Moreover, the lack of Singapore-specific or even Asia-specific data on
genetic drivers and disease outcomes are a significant knowledge gap that
the&nbsp;National Precision Medicine (NPM) programme aims to bridge.&nbsp;“There
is an opportunity to use genetic information for interception of disease
early on,” said Professor Patrick Tan, Executive Director of NPM. “By integrating
data and identifying triggers that will manifest disease early, we can
keep people healthier for longer.”</p>
<p>For PM to advance from bench to bedside, Professor Tan emphasised that
concerted efforts are needed to identify persisting barriers and address
unmet needs. Researchers and clinicians are meticulously refining the model
for implementing such services, carefully evaluating the risks and benefits
as well as devising strategies to bolster the workforce with capabilities
like genetic counselling training.</p>
<p>“At a societal level, precision medicine will allow early intervention,
thereby reducing the incidence of late-stage cancers and improving overall
population health,” concluded Adjunct Associate Professor Leong Khai Pang,
Head of TTSH’s Personalised Medicine Service.&nbsp;By reinforcing the value
of data-driven clinical management and making these solutions more accessible,
services like TTSH’s&nbsp;Cancer Genetics and Genomics Clinic&nbsp;are
laying the groundwork to embed PM in the healthcare system for the benefit
of all.</p>
