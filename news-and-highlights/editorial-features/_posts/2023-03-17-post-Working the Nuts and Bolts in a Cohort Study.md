the potential to learn factors associated with health and diseases that
Singaporeans—and possibly half the world’s population—are predisposed to.
More excitingly, this knowledge promises to shape the precision medicine
landscape.</p>
<hr>
<p>Associate Professor Sim Xueling from the National University of Singapore,
Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health shares insights on what it is like
to be running&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.nus.edu.sg/sphs/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Singapore Population Health Study</a>&nbsp;which
is part of Singapore’s largest longitudinal study—SG100K, the progress
thus far, and her hopes for it.</p>
<p><strong>What is the thinking behind SG100K?</strong>
</p>
<p>Human beings are generally quite similar. But there are exceptions where
we see disease occurring more often in some than others. With cohort studies,
we are trying to see these similarities and differences between populations
and make adjustments to change the trajectory or improve the outcomes.</p>
<p>One of the things that is&nbsp;unique about SG100K is that our data spans
across Chinese, Malay and Indian. This makes it potentially translatable
to half the world. It also offers an opportunity to compare our findings
against that of other international cohort studies. Hopefully, this puts
us in a position to better predict health risks—and possibly, prevent and
delay them from happening.</p>
<p><strong>What does a successful cohort study look like?</strong>
</p>
<p>One of the earliest cohort studies in the world was the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.framinghamheartstudy.org/participants/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Framingham Heart Study</a>.
It was started in 1948, Massachusetts, with a cohort size of approximately
5,200 men and women. The cardiovascular risk prediction model which was
first built from the study is still in use today.</p>
<p>There is a certain intricacy to ensuring that the cohort size is sufficiently
large—because if there are only 100 persons in the research, estimates
are less precise and it is hard to tell if this group of people coincidentally
shares the same predisposition. That probability is reduced when the sample
size is bigger. Also, having a certain size helps buffer against dropouts.
Cross-checking against other similar studies provides a good gauge.</p>
<p><strong>What does it take to run a successful cohort?</strong>
</p>
<p>Running&nbsp;a cohort has many moving parts. Besides recruiting participants
and inviting them back every five years, we need to put in place an infrastructure
where data collected is comparable across different time periods and useful
for anyone who has use for them. This can sometimes be tricky because five
years is a long time and many things&nbsp;such as lifestyle behaviour,
external environment, generational perspectives&nbsp;can change.&nbsp;For
example, 10 years ago, there is little talk about wholegrain. Today, we
have a whole range of wholegrain products from rice to pasta. These changes
can have a significant impact on data collection and how they relate to
what is happening.</p>
<p>Currently, we tackle these challenges by continuously reviewing what we
have collected and scanning the environment to check the relevance of what
we have collected or if there is a new set of data we should collect.</p>
<p>In addition, we actively encourage researchers to come on board the journey
with us by using the data we have collected and suggesting to us what other
data they might be interested in. For this to happen, we need to first
make sure that our data is curated, reusable, and easily accessible. Data
sharing rules and principles are also clearly outlined.</p>
<p><strong>What are some outcomes we can expect from SG100K?</strong>
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.framinghamheartstudy.org/participants/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">SG100K</a>&nbsp;is
a central part of the National Precision Medicine (NPM) Phase II with PRECISE.
In the last five years, some of the SG100K cohorts were part of the NPM
Phase I (SG10K). That has enabled us to lay the foundation for collaboration
and data sharing among partner institutions. As we gain momentum on the
SG100K study, we will continue to build on the learning and the infrastructure,
and reinforce them. Particularly, we can look forward to larger and more
diverse public and private partnerships, e.g., the establishment of the&nbsp;
<a href="/precise-illumina-partnership-agreement/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">PRECISE-Illumina partnership agreement</a>&nbsp;for the generation of
whole genomes for SG100K.</p>
<p>When we run cohorts, there is always something new—be it a new specimen
type or a new dimension of data. Interestingly though, while we are collecting
and building these data resources for future use, we cannot really future
proof what we have collected. Because we only know so much now and that
influences the types of samples and data we collect now. There is also
the issue of cost and time versus benefit. Sample and data collection can
be costly because of the technology used to collect, process, store and
extract data. Oftentimes, the collected biological specimens require long-term
storage arrangement—this is another hidden cost.</p>
<p>Nonetheless,&nbsp;understanding why diseases develop in some people, but
not others, is such a critical step to the development of new approaches
to prevent, delay, diagnose and treat diseases. Hence, SG100K is really
an important infrastructure resource for precision medicine which aligns
with the Ministry of Health’s “Healthier SG” blueprint for preventive care.
It enables us to track the cohort’s biomarkers and ask the tough question
as to whether we can use precision medicine to change things for these
people. Quite often, this involves a systemic change in healthcare—from
the way things are done in clinics to how the population embraces the knowledge
and changes its lifestyle beyond the healthcare settings.</p>
<p>Running a cohort is like running a never-ending experiment. There is never
really quite an end to the experiment, as how people live constantly changes.
There is always more to learn with each wave—that warrants a next wave.
The same goes for cohort studies.</p>
