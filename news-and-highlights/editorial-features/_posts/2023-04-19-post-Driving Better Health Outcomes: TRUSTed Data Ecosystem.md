<p>Mention precision medicine and what probably comes to mind are cutting-edge
technologies such as genome sequencing and pharmacogenomics. But without
safe and expedient access to good data, these technologies remain promises.</p>
<hr>
<p>“Data is key to unlocking the full potential of precision medicine,” says
Ms. Koh&nbsp;Mingshi, Director, Chief Health Scientist Office, Ministry
of Health. “To provide valuable insights from precision medicine, we need
to be able to bring together and analyse different types of data safely
and in a manner that engenders trust.”</p>
<p>However, there are prevailing challenges in accessing the broad spectrum
of health, research and social-related data sets. “Based on feedback from
researchers, it is not unusual for researchers to write to many different
organisations and approving authorities to get data access,” says Mingshi.
“In some cases, by the time data approvals are obtained and they get the
data they need, their research grant funding period could be over. There
is also a lack of a central trusted third party and secure platform to
help bring different types of data together. At the same time, varying
data standards in the field make it challenging to analyse multiple data
sources efficiently to generate deep insights.”</p>
<h4><strong>TRUST in a Common Platform</strong></h4>
<p>TRUST aims to address these challenges—for both precision medicine and
healthcare research. Short for&nbsp;“Trusted Research and Real world-data
Utilisation and Sharing Tech”, TRUST&nbsp;is&nbsp;jointly developed by
the Smart Nation and Digital Government Office (SNDGO), Government Technology
Agency (GovTech), Integrated Health Information Systems (IHiS) and the
Ministry of Health (MOH).</p>
<p>Operationalised in November 2022, TRUST is currently in the second of
its three-phase roadmap. “Taking a phased approach enables us to be nimbler
and more flexible in responding to user needs and technology developments,”
Mingshi shares. “And thanks to strong partnerships with the larger community,
we have accomplished much in our first phase.”</p>
<p>Under its first phase, TRUST has adopted the Five Safes Framework (an
internationally recognised framework covering data use and access); developed
the pilot phase data sharing platform, anonymisation and fusion tools to
enable linkages and safe sharing; established the TRUST Data Access Committee
(DAC) to oversee and approve all data requests; determined permissibility
and governance of TRUST datasets; finalised national level pre-agreements
terms for data requestors and contributors which spells out how data will
be shared and used; as well as completed proof-of-concept use cases involving
datasets across research institutions and real world data.</p>
<p>Mingshi adds, “TRUST continues to evolve in the second phase—with a focus
on enhancing user experience. As we give greater priority to users from
Singapore’s public research organisations in the current phase, we realised
there is a wide spectrum of users—ranging from data scientists to those
who are less familiar with coding, programming and/or machine learning.
This is why we are progressively introducing new tools and solutions to
enable TRUST to cater to a broader user group. This will prepare TRUST
for the third phase, where we open up to other users.”</p>
<h4><strong>TRUST in Precision Medicine</strong></h4>
<p>Foreseeably, as Singapore embarks on the National Precision Medicine (NPM)
programme, TRUST will play an important role in supporting the endeavour.
Mingshi explains, “Precision medicine is essentially about being able to
provide more precise health and healthcare insights and interventions for
individuals or a targeted segment of the population. This will require
a system of bringing together and analysing different types of health-related
data (clinical, genomic, phenotypic, social, environmental) safely and
expeditiously.</p>
<p>“That is where&nbsp;TRUST comes in.&nbsp;It brings together health-related
research and real-world data across different organisations and institutions
to enable anonymised data sharing and analytics. This helps to realise
the full potential of large-scale population cohort studies like SG100K.&nbsp;Furthermore,
researchers can now interface with just one party—TRUST—to access interoperable
datasets. The time saved from going to numerous data owners can instead
be channelled to generating new or deeper insights.”</p>
<h4><strong>TRUST in Advancing Research</strong></h4>
<p>Beyond smoothening the data access process for researchers, TRUST aims
to create an ecosystem where data contributors and requestors stand to
benefit. Data contributors will enjoy priority access to link their research
data with other TRUST data, and also benefit from support by TRUST’s data
cleaning team to organise their data in a format interoperable with international
standards.</p>
<p>At the same time, data contributors retain the right to comment on requests
for their data that come through TRUST, opening up new opportunities for
research collaboration with other parties. On the other hand, requestors
enjoy a more seamless process for accessing a wide range of health-related
research and real-world data. Mingshi says, “TRUST therefore serves as
a collaboration network for data contributors and requestors alike. And
in the long run, this adds to the pool of available data for researchers
to power their research.”</p>
<h4><strong>TRUST in the Future</strong></h4>
<p>TRUST aims to be a valuable resource for the research community—in Singapore
and globally. As the team focuses efforts on bringing different types of
data onboard TRUST and expanding the types of use cases TRUST can support,
improvements such as privacy preserving technologies continue to be tested
and incorporated.</p>
<p>Mingshi says, “Our conversation and engagement with the research community
will be an active and iterative one to ensure that the platform continues
to address needs of the community. And through facilitating the researchers’
work, we hope to generate value and bring better health outcomes for society.”</p>
