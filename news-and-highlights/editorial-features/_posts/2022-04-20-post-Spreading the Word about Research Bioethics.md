<p><em>Engaging large and diverse groups of the public in discussions related to bioethics will ensure that biomedical research and related policies continue to benefit humanity.</em>
</p>
<p>Did you know that moral practices in medicine date back to antiquity?
One the first known documented examples, the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocratic_Oath#:~:text=The%20Hippocratic%20Oath%20is%20an,to%20uphold%20specific%20ethical%20standards." rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Hippocratic Oath</a>,
describes the ethical responsibilities physicians have to their patients,
including the famous maxim to do no harm.&nbsp;However, such ethical concerns
about moral standards are not confined to just medical practitioners—biomedical
researchers also have a moral obligation to citizens. After all, biomedical
research aims to&nbsp;understand the body for the benefit of society and
is often publicly funded.&nbsp;“The public needs to have confidence that
what is done in their name, and often with public resources, does indeed
serve the public good,” said Dr Victor Cole, a Senior Research Fellow and
Programme Director of the National University of Singapore’s Centre for
Biomedical Ethics. “Equally, it is important for policy-makers and those
working in the biomedical research sector to recognise the importance of
the public as stakeholders.”</p>
<p>In 2000, the Singaporean government put these priorities into practice
by establishing the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bioethics-singapore.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Bioethics Advisory Committee (BAC)</a>&nbsp;to
address the ethical, legal and social issues arising from biomedical sciences
research in Singapore and to act as an intermediary between the public
and researchers.&nbsp;In the penultimate chapter of a 20th&nbsp;anniversary
commemorative BAC publication titled “The Future of Bioethics in Singapore”1,
Cole, who has hosted several events on bioethics in Singapore, discussed
the importance of public engagement in the country’s bioethics landscape.</p>
<p><strong>Making bioethics everyone’s business</strong>
</p>
<p>The BAC’s main missions are to educate and raise awareness of bioethics-related
issues, procure feedback on views held by the public and provide recommendations
to policy-makers. Counsel from the BAC has also set the groundwork for
bioethics across Singapore’s booming research landscape.</p>
<p>The nation’s rich multiethnic population makes BAC’s work engaging the
public particularly important. According to Cole, giving both minority
and majority groups equal opportunity to voice their opinions paves the
way for the ideal “deliberative democracy,” which places the careful weighing
of options at the centre of decision-making.</p>
<p>In relation to biomedical research, public engagement fosters trust that
could have lasting impact on new endeavours. “By building trust with its
stakeholders, the biomedical research sector can generate both practical
and moral support for its activities and move forward with confidence,”
Cole said.</p>
<p><strong>An evolving landscape</strong>
</p>
<p>Bioethical concerns in Singapore, as in many countries, have followed
emerging biomedical advances and their applications, said Cole. For example,
in the early 2000s, human stem cell research raised questions about the
sources from which those cells were obtained.</p>
<p>Since then, ethics concerning the use of human biological samples in research
have shifted focus towards issues related to consent and the combined psychological
and social implications of related technologies. These themes continue
into current day, as the growth of genomics and precision medicine contributes
to the debate surrounding health data privacy.&nbsp;One such example is
precision medicine. With the aim of delivering more targeted therapeutic
options to patient groups, precision medicine programmes require the genomic
and health data of many individuals. However, the sharing of such health
data involves much ethical consideration.</p>
<p>“Genomic data that is gathered from individuals to facilitate more targeted
medical interventions may involve sensitive information that the individuals
concerned would not want linked back to them personally,” explained Cole.&nbsp;According
to recent studies that conducted focus groups2&nbsp;and surveys&nbsp;3&nbsp;of
Singaporeans, individuals typically&nbsp;weigh conflicting factors such
as data security, perceived benefits and trust&nbsp;when considering whether
to contribute their personal information. From this, Cole noted that traditional
public engagement methods like focus groups could be useful strategies
to gather nuanced opinions on the complex ethical issues surrounding biomedical
research.</p>
<p><strong>A new generation of engagement</strong>
</p>
<p>Just as scientific discoveries continue to morph bioethics, Cole highlights
that changes in the way we communicate will also affect how organisations
like the BAC should engage the public in bioethics.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example,
the BAC has traditionally organised in-person multi-media&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bioethics-singapore.gov.sg/activities/events/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">events</a>&nbsp;to
engage the public in discussions related to bioethics. Cole notes that
while these strategies will continue to be important in educating and engaging
the public in bioethics, digital tools such as social media, blogs and
online forums should be explored going forward.</p>
<p>Cole added that the myriad of online meeting platforms and webinars that
arose out of the COVID-19 pandemic could also expand the reach of the BAC,
allowing it to engage larger and more diverse groups in discussions about
bioethics.&nbsp;According to Cole, changes in Singapore’s funding environment
have also led bioethical training to become increasingly integrated with
the growth of the biomedical sector. In recent years, professionals like
clinician scientists have become the targets of educational efforts.</p>
<p>“In other words, there has been greater emphasis on building public understanding
of biomedical research that is intended to have particular practical applications,”
said Cole.&nbsp;“Bioethics as a field of inquiry has matured to the extent
that it has found a more established place within the public consciousness,
which I think is a sign of progress,” he concluded.</p>
