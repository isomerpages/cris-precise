<p><em>Precision medicine is elevating preventative healthcare by offering a nuanced understanding of individual disease risk</em>&nbsp;<em>and opening the door to novel methods of screening.</em>
</p>
<p>In 2018, a person diagnosed with breast cancer in Singapore had a&nbsp;
<a href="https://www.nrdo.gov.sg/docs/librariesprovider3/default-document-library/scr-annual-report-2018.pdf?sfvrsn=bcf56c25_0" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">60% greater likelihood of surviving</a>&nbsp;than a person diagnosed 40
years earlier. Despite the number of breast cancer cases more than doubling
during the same period, the prognosis for breast cancer are now much better.</p>
<p>A major reason driving higher survival rates is because breast&nbsp;cancers
in Singapore are increasingly being diagnosed in their&nbsp;<a href="https://www.singhealth.com.sg/news/medical-news-singhealth/landscape-breast-cancer-screening-treatment-singapore" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">early stages</a>:
as many as 70% of those breast cancer cases in 2018 were diagnosed at Stage
I and II. This is a clear case of how preventative healthcare strategies
like screening, or timely detection of diseases, can potentially save thousands
of lives when applied to populations.</p>
<p><strong>Prevention is better than cure</strong>
</p>
<p>At its core, preventative healthcare involves identifying individuals
who may be at risk of diseases that can be avoided through lifestyle changes
or other preventive measures. The concept is divided into three categories:
primary, secondary and tertiary prevention.&nbsp;Primary prevention aims
to empower communities to take charge of their own health and prevent diseases
before they even develop. This may be achieved through vaccination programmes
or health promotion strategies such as Singapore’s National Steps Challenge,
which motivated&nbsp;<a href="https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/54/17/1047" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">1.3 million people</a>&nbsp;aged
17 years or older to live more active lifestyles.</p>
<p>The goal of secondary prevention, on the other hand, is to detect disease
as early as possible—ideally before the onset of symptoms—through screening
strategies such as the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthhub.sg/programmes/61/Screen_for_Life" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Screen for Life</a>&nbsp;programme.
Finally, tertiary prevention seeks to reduce the severity and progression
of a disease after its onset by using measures such as chemotherapy and
other therapeutic treatments.</p>
<p>Although its outcomes are typically “invisible” compared to those of curative
interventions, preventative healthcare was identified by Singapore’s Ministry
of Health as a powerful tool to tackle emerging challenges like the country’s
ageing population. In fact, “<a href="https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/data2/BookSG/publish/6/6abae60d-e19f-4b4b-b480-f6dde3219709/web/html5/index.html?opf=tablet/BOOKSG.xml&amp;launchlogo=tablet/BOOKSG_BrandingLogo_.png&amp;pn=7" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">prevention is better than cure</a>”
was the mantra of the National Healthcare Plan (NHP) in 1983. Today, the
Ministry of Health continues to invest in the strategy, having&nbsp;
<a href="https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/preventive-care-spending-and-impact" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">allocated $720 million</a>&nbsp;to preventative healthcare in 2021.</p>
<p><strong>Enhancing prevention with precision</strong>
</p>
<p>Alongside the environment, our genes—specifically the mutations found
in our DNA and their combinations—are the biggest determinants of our risk
of diseases. Therefore, understanding every individual’s genetics could
take the prevention strategies several notches higher by helping predict
disease earlier and diagnose them more accurately.</p>
<p>This is one of the promises of&nbsp;<a href="/what-precision-medicine-is-not/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">precision medicine</a>, which factors
in variations in genetics, lifestyle and environment to offer diagnosis
and treatment better tailored to specific patient groups. Like many countries
around the world, Singapore has set up an action plan in the form of its
National Precision Medicine (NPM) programme to harness the potential of
precision medicine.</p>
<p>Phase I of the ten-year programme, which launched in 2017, saw the completion
of the world’s largest genetics database on multi-ethnic Asian individuals.
The 10,000-person-large repository will serve as a reference for identifying
genetic variants that may be linked to disease risk—findings that could
expand the types of diseases that can be detected early and inspire the
development of new screening tools.</p>
<p>One such emerging method is to use microRNA (miRNA)—short pieces of RNA
that are involved in turning genes on and off—as indicators of complex
diseases such as cancer and stroke. Just as glucose levels are measured
to indicate diabetes risk, measuring the expression levels of different
disease-specific miRNAs could be a quick and inexpensive way to determine
a person’s risk of developing that disease.</p>
<p><strong>Taking it to the clinic</strong>
</p>
<p>To pass on the benefits of precision medicine to patients, the crucial
next step is to take the technology from the laboratory to the clinic—a
major goal of Phase II of the NPM, which began in 2021. Clinical partners
across Singapore have already begun piloting precision medicine programs,
including at the National University of Singapore (NUS)’s Centre for Personalised
and Precision Health and DUKE-NUS’s Institute of Precision Medicine (PRISM).&nbsp;At
the same time, the use of miRNA as biomarkers for early disease detection
is catching up. Until recently, miRNA-based assays were largely used for
diagnosis, prognosis and understanding a patient’s response to particular
therapeutics and their use for screening is currently confined to a small
number of clinical laboratories.</p>
<p>But new&nbsp;<a href="https://www.singaporestandardseshop.sg/Product/SSPdtDetail/952ba6cf-6c1e-4712-9719-07bd5ece3f09" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">national standards</a>&nbsp;published
by Singaporean researchers in 2020 to guide the design, development and
evaluation of miRNA-based assays are already leading to the development
of commercial “point-of-care” testing devices. Validated tests for gastric
and lung cancers and even multiple cancers at once are nearing&nbsp;
<a href="/news-and-events/editorial-features/pushing-the-boundaries-of-cancer-care/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">commercial availability</a>.</p>
<p>Bringing the reality of precision medicine to Singapore is a long-term
strategy, and NPM is steadily moving toward that goal. As researchers continue
to gain understanding of the genetic basis of specific diseases and clinicians
apply that knowledge in their clinical practice, they will be better equipped
to catch more ailments earlier, giving the public a better chance of living
longer, healthier lives.</p>
