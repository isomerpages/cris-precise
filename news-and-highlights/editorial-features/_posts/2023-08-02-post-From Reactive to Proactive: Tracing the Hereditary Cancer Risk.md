<p>Cost can be a barrier to the uptake of genetic testing and cascade screening.
In addition, factors such as non-systematic referral of patients, and poor
understanding of the need for genetic testing among patients and their
family members also contribute to the current reactivity of hereditary
cancer risk testing in Singapore.</p>
<p>Seeing the opportunity to address these gaps and implement a sustainable
genetic testing programme for hereditary cancer risks, Associate Professor
Joanne Ngeow, Head and Senior Consultant, Cancer Genetics Service, National
Cancer Centre Singapore and Associate Professor, Genomic Medicine, Lee
Kong Chian School of Medicine, and Associate Professor Ken Redekop, Erasmus
School of Health Policy and Management, Erasmus University Rotterdam, embarked
on a&nbsp;<a href="/clinical-implementation-pilot/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_self">clinical implementation pilot</a>&nbsp;(CIP)
together—despite a geographical divide and a six-hour time difference.</p>
<p><strong>Changing the Focus from Treatment to Prevention</strong>
</p>
<p>“For most cancers, when patients go from pre-disease to disease, they
increasingly have more symptoms. As a medical oncologist, it is not unusual
that I only see them then. By the time their diagnosis is confirmed, I
can only offer reactive care—and prescribe medicines—at best,” A/Prof Ngeow
shared. “But what if we can find a way to identify these individuals before
any actual pre-clinical symptoms present? It will be better for the individual,
but also much better for our healthcare system.”</p>
<p>This CIP presents an opportunity to explore the viability and scalability
of such an implementation. A/Prof Ngeow said, “We know from our past research
that if we can improve cascade screening uptake to 30%, subsidising testing
will be overall cost neutral to the healthcare system. But the question
is, how can we sustainably increase the cascade testing rates from the
current 10% to 15% to 30%<sup>[2]</sup> —given our observation and understanding
of current clinical practices? With this CIP, all hands are on deck to
produce data that provides good, solid evidence on how we can do this in
a safe and cost-efficient manner.”</p>
<p><strong>Creating the Playbook for Hereditary Cancer Cascade Screening</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Agreeing, A/Prof Redekop said, “Exactly—this CIP is unique in that it
doesn’t stop at research, data collection and analysis. It goes all the
way to include implementation specifics. And if we think about it, that
is really the most important link here—transforming insights into actual
applications to help patients, their loved ones and the healthcare system.”</p>
<p>A/Prof Redekop continued, “Notably, Singapore’s size and availability
of resources are advantageous towards this cause. They allow for deep understanding
of issues, swift implementation of insights, evaluation of outcomes, and
further adaptation as necessary. For example, through the pilot Resource
Utilisation Study (RUS) funded by PRECISE, we were able to prove that offering
virtual consults to individuals through a dedicated cascade testing clinic
can reduce appointment waiting time for probands and their FDRs—and consequently,
significantly improve uptake and compliance.”</p>
<p>“Concurrently, we are exploring the feasibility of a registry-aided outreach
approach—because we found from one of our prior studies that relatives
of probands tend to have a poor understanding of the significance and relevance
of genetic testing to them. We recognise that this could be a result of
probands being ill-equipped to explain benefits and implications of cascade
screening,” explained A/Prof Ngeow. “With the registry-aided outreach approach,
healthcare personnel will help reach out and discuss implications of germline
cascade screening with at-risk relatives—reducing reliance on the proband
to disseminate genetic test results while ensuring the accuracy of disseminated
information.”</p>
<p><strong>Going Beyond Genetic Testing for Hereditary Cancer</strong>
</p>
<p>Four other CIPs are running concurrent to this one. Among which, cascade
screening is a recurring theme not only for hereditary cancer, but also
for&nbsp;<a href="/getting-to-the-heart-of-the-matter/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_self">familial hypercholesterolemia</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;
<a href="/genetic-testing-for-primary-glomerular-disease-life-changing/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_self">primary glomerular diseases</a>. A/Prof Ngeow commented, “Indeed, this
is one of very few projects that brings together multiple institutions
and disciplines to share resources and exchange expertise—in a systematic,
coherent and cohesive manner—towards fostering a better healthcare system
for everyone.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>A/Prof Ngeow summed up, “It has been exciting and enriching thus far—we
get to learn from one another’s experiences and find synergy in our proposed
solutions. But at the end of the day, it only counts if we can take all
these findings and implement them widely. And the way I see it, building
a strong pipeline of genetics-trained talents and improving the general
genetic literacy of all stakeholders are integral to the sustainability
of the good efforts we’ve invested in so far.”</p>
<p>“That’s right. While our efforts for this CIP focus on hereditary cancer,
there is definitely a huge potential for generalising the knowledge to
other diseases—and even other countries and geographic regions. I am hopeful
what we are doing now will benefit many people—and for many years ahead,”
A/Prof Redekop smiled.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
