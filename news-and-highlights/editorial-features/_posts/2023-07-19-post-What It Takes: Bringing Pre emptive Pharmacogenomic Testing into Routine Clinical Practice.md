<p><em>Currently when a patient presents with trigeminal neuralgia or painful neuropathy, doctors would need to do a genotyping test for the human leukocyte antigen B gene’s 1502 allele (HLA-B*1502) prior to the initiation of carbamazepine (CBZ) therapy. This is because patients who carry the HLA-B*1502 allele are at higher risk of experiencing CBZ-induced Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis, which can be life-threatening and even prove fatal.[1]</em>

<p>The need for genotyping prior to starting therapy typically means that
patients need to wait days to weeks for the return of their&nbsp;pharmacogenomics
(PGx) testing results before commencing on their prescriptions.</p>
<p>For Professor Goh Boon Cher, Department of Haematology-Oncology, National
University Cancer Institute, Singapore; Associate Professor Wee Hwee Lin,
Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore;
and Dr Elaine Lo, Principal Clinical Pharmacist, Clinical Support Services,
Pharmacy, National University Hospital, they are piloting a project to
study how patients and clinicians can potentially start therapy confidently
and with little delay or wait time.</p>

<p>“Just imagine—if we can screen a broad panel of multiple genes for multiple
drugs and make the test results readily available and accessible in our
electronic medical records (EMR) system, clinicians will be able to make
prompt prescription decisions at the point-of-care,” said Prof Goh. “But
before that can happen, we’ll need to understand why, despite increasing
availability of clinical guidance on how prescribing should be modified
based on PGx test results, the uptake remains low.”</p>
<p>“Pre-emptive PGx testing is presently not widely adopted due to barriers
such as a lack of awareness and guidance, long turnaround time, counter-intuitive
workflows, and the additional costs of testing itself. Hence, our goal
with this&nbsp;<a href="https://www.npm.sg/cip/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">clinical implementation pilot</a>&nbsp;(CIP)
is to find ways to navigate around these issues—and optimise drug therapy
outcomes for patients at the same time,” said Dr Lo.</p>
<p><strong>Tackling Cost Concerns</strong>
</p>
<p>In a study A/Prof Wee conducted in 2018 at the Singapore General Hospital,
it was noted that the total cost of 81 admissions caused by adverse drug
reactions (ADRs) was S$770,000. It was noted that the breakeven cost of
a pre-emptive PGx test for patients taking warfarin, clopidogrel, chemotherapeutic
and neuropsychiatric drugs was S$154 per patient.[2]&nbsp;A/Prof Wee said,
“We just need to put these numbers side by side, and it becomes immediately
clear that pre-emptive PGx testing is not only cheaper to the patient,
but likely also the healthcare system.”</p>
<p>Prof Goh added, “The cost of genotyping today is relatively affordable
because of more powerful testing equipment and more efficient process workflow.
Additionally, in pre-emptive PGx testing, we are testing for common variants
in the population. They are neither diagnostic nor prognostic—and no pre-
and post-genetic counselling is required; there is less concern about cascade
screening too.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dr Lo continued, “Also, although we are only looking at a PGx panel of
about 30 drug-gene pairs, the impact goes beyond 30 genes because many
drugs are metabolised by just a few specific enzymes—so it is actually
very economical. A multi-gene panel saves the trouble of patients having
to go through multiple single-gene testing in their lives.”&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Increasing Awareness Among Clinicians and Patients</strong>
</p>
<p>“We found that when we are able to explain the merits of pre-emptive PGx
testing, share the costs and assure patients that all we need is a simple
blood draw, patients are usually quite receptive. And if the advice came
from a doctor, there is a high chance that patients will agree to do the
test,” Prof Goh shared.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides costs, another key limitation to the adoption of pre-emptive PGx
testing is clinicians’ awareness and knowledge about the types of tests
available, when they are required, and how to order, interpret and incorporate
PGx test results in the context of other clinical variables.</p>
<p>“PGx is a relatively new tool in medicine—and many practising clinicians
haven’t had much exposure in this area during their time in school. However,
it is nothing that cannot be overcome. Some education and encouragement
to try will be a good first step. Then when the clinicians realise that
this helps them with their drug dosing and achieve more positive patient
outcomes, they will be interested,” Prof Goh said. “That is why part of
our focus now is to score some early wins so as to get the implementation
off to a steady state. But as CIP investigators, we are also careful to
set the right expectations and understanding. For example, pre-emptive
PGx can help to reduce the odds of ADRs, but provided that it is used appropriately.”</p>
<p><strong>Enabling Smoother Clinical Workflows</strong>
</p>
<p>As part of the CIP, the team is also thinking about the sustainability
of pre-emptive PGx information as part of the clinical practice. Dr Lo
explained, “Today, whenever a patient does a PGx test, the clinic not only
needs to trace the patient’s sample and test results to ensure that they
are returned, they will also need to follow up with the patient to inform
them of the outcome and whether they can start their prescribed medicine.
This is disruptive to the process at clinics. That is why sometimes clinicians
choose not to order the PGx test or avoid drugs that require PGx tests
altogether.”</p>
<p>Prof Goh said, “That’s right. This is where the EMR plays an integral
role to our implementation. We want to make it such that every patient’s
PGx information is available to the clinician at the point of prescription.
Then taking it one step further, the PGx information also has to be relevant
to the particular episode and easily seen at a glance—because clinicians
are seeing many patients within a session so anything that takes up extra
time or hinders the flow of their clinical consultations is not going to
be sustainable. I can attest to that first-hand as a clinician myself.”</p>
<p>“To Prof Goh’s point—that’s primarily why we take great effort in ensuring
that information is presented succinctly and language use is moderated
so that healthcare professionals assessing the EMR don’t over- or under
react. We hope to build a workflow that can minimise doctors’ workload—so
the doctors would be prompted with the PGx information when there is an
important drug interaction and they won’t have to remember what to do with
the drug,” Dr Lo elaborated.</p>
<p>Dr Lo continued, “Ultimately, I believe that if we can produce evidence
of how pre-emptive PGx can benefit clinicians to do their job better, and
patients in terms of reducing side effects and optimising efficacy, we
would have a good case for implementing pre-emptive PGx as a precision
medicine tool.”</p>
<p>“Yes—we know we have succeeded if all doctors can confidently select the
best drug and dose so that patients do not lose the chance of response
or is subjected to a preventable toxicity, and yet they will receive the
best potential therapeutic outcomes,” Prof Goh concluded.</p>
