<p>As the saying goes, prevention is better than cure. But how do you deliver
preventive care at scale—for 68 million people—in a way that is evidence-based
and cost-effective? The UK’s Our Future Health<a href="https://ourfuturehealth.org.uk/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><sup>[1]</sup></a> research project
is aiming to crack this puzzle.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Many would have heard of the National Health Service (NHS), the United
Kingdom (UK)’s public healthcare system—a single-payer system which offers
comprehensive and universal medical services to UK residents at all stages
of life.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Yet, according to Dr Raghib Ali, Chief Executive and Chief Medical Officer
of Our Future Health, the NHS currently functions more like a national
‘sickness’ service. He said, “Typically, we only see patients after they’ve
developed symptoms or experienced a life-threatening episode such as stroke.
At which point, it’s usually too late to prevent disease onset or even
restore patients to good health.”&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>He continued, “What we want to do with Our Future Health is change our
current health model—from focusing on treating late-stage disease to pivoting
and sharpening our efforts on early detection and intervention. In the
process, we hope to reduce disease burden on the NHS and society.” Through
combining and analysing health information such as genetic data and NHS
medical records of participants in the programme, the aim is also to leverage
these insights to develop screening tests and interventions for high-risk
individuals.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Gathering the World’s Largest Cohort&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>Our Future Health began in October 2022 with the goal of recruiting five
million adult participants aged 18 and above from across the UK. As of
January 2025, over two million participants have signed up, and more than
a million blood samples have been collected. It is the largest cohort study
of its kind in the UK and the world<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03438-0.epdf?sharing_token=ZOCUDdf3OiZCbGCQMUJXq9RgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0NMGv8TmvOemTcGw5DrDpRRK0MJs2ghzSfs_aE5vn8bqaeSeTP3GE4shPPR0lgecvYr6sCAj1KL1sXNG6QZmBssZgVSG58u7wUJEvGDx12ikvXrsjtQJds-jLXYLpxkTrs%3D" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><sup>[2]</sup></a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>While the participation rate and support for the programme is promising,
Dr Ali emphasised that Our Future Health’s scale goes beyond mere numbers.
To better reflect the UK’s diverse and multi-ethnic society, the team is
casting the net wide—to ensure ethnic, socioeconomic, and geographical
representation. The aim is to recruit at least 10% of its cohort—about
half a million—from ethnic minority communities.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Dr Ali said, “Health outcomes can look very different for people from
different backgrounds. For instance, South Asians are at higher risk for
diabetes<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7531132/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><sup>[3]</sup></a> while
men of African descent are more likely to develop prostate cancer<a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9826514/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"><sup>[4]</sup></a>—but
we don’t exactly know why.” With a diverse cohort, researchers will be
able to track disease incidence and progression for underrepresented groups
better.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>In addition, Our Future Health’s planned scale offers unique opportunities
for studying rare diseases. “It’s often challenging to obtain enough patient
data with small cohort sizes. There are also limitations to combining data
from multiple cohorts—which could have different data collection parameters
or follow-up methods,” Dr Ali explained. “By establishing a single, comprehensive
resource, I believe we lay the groundwork for transformational discoveries.”&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Establishing a Positive Feedback Loop</strong>&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Even as recruitment efforts continue, Dr Ali and his team have already
started deliberating the details for the next stage—returning feedback
to participants starting from 2025. “That’s our core premise,” Dr Ali said.
“Providing participants information about their health risks—so they can
take action and change the course.”&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Participants currently receive basic measurements and feedback at the
end of their initial appointment with Our Future Health, such as blood
pressure, heart rate and cholesterol levels. Looking ahead, the plan is
to follow-up with more information on their disease risk based on lifestyle
and genetic factors, and recruit participants for clinical trials on potential
interventions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>However, before that can happen, there are various considerations. Top
of mind for Dr Ali is to prevent any additional strain to the NHS. “We
want to avoid overwhelming NHS staff with patients seeking clarification
on Our Future Health feedback. At the same time, we want to ensure that
any preventive health initiatives we introduce should integrate with—and
not overburden—existing clinical workflows.”&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Discussion is also underway for the conditions to focus on—for a start.
The team is looking at diseases such as diabetes and colorectal cancer
which already have age-based screening programmes—to study the utility
and cost-effectiveness of introducing a risk-stratified approach. Participant
views are also being sought as to the type of information they are keen
to receive.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Embarking on the Roadmap to Global Health</strong>&nbsp;</h3>
<p>With the target of completing recruitment by 2028, Our Future Health is
in the early days. “It could take decades to fully realise the extent of
Our Future Health’s potential—where we successfully reduce overall usage
of the healthcare system through early intervention,” Dr Ali explained.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>While Our Future Health’s full roadmap stretches into the years ahead,
he hopes to see outcomes as soon as 2035—establishing new evidence-based
approaches to tackling conditions such as diabetes, heart disease and common
cancers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>But Dr Ali has a bigger vision for Our Future Health. He said, “Chronic
illnesses, multimorbidity, ageing populations—these are pressing problems
not only for the UK but also many countries around the world. Novel interventions
from Our Future Health data could therefore potentially transform global
healthcare systems.”&nbsp;</p>
