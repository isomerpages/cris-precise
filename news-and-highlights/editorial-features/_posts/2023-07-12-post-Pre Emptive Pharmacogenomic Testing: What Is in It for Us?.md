<p><em>Did you know—adverse drug reactions (ADRs) cause Singapore patients to spend an extrapolated 48,000 extra days a year in hospitals[1]? According to a study done by a team of researchers at the Agency of Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) and the Singapore General Hospital (SGH), about 30% of ADRs admitted to SGH were caused by at least one drug with a clinical annotation in the Pharmacogenomics KnowledgeBase (PharmGKB), suggesting that some of these ADRs could have been pre-empted by pharmacogenomic testing.[2]</em>

<p>While opportunities for optimising drug response according to patients’
genetic profiles are significant, the lack of ready clinical pharmacogenomics
(PGx) information at the point of medication prescription is currently
preventing clinicians from realising these benefits.</p>
<p>Dr Elaine Lo, Principal Clinical Pharmacist, Clinical Support Services,
Pharmacy, National University Hospital, said, “In clinical practice, we
typically order clinical PGx testing when we are either prescribing a pharmaco-genetically
high-risk drug or in response to unexplained adverse events. Even then,
PGx is only done on a single-gene for a single-drug basis.”</p>
<p>Professor Goh Boon Cher, Department of Haematology-Oncology, National
University Cancer Institute, Singapore, added, “Currently, the whole process
is largely reactive, and the panel of PGx information is incomplete—which
means to say that a new prescription sometime down the road will require
another PGx testing to be conducted. In comparison, if we were to screen
a broad panel of about 16 genes for 30 drugs, through pre-emptive PGx testing
and store this information in our linked electronic medical records, a
clinician would be able to prescribe the required medication promptly and
confidently rather than wait several days for PGx results to be returned.”</p>
<p><strong>A Safeguard Against Adverse Drug Events</strong>
</p>
<p>In August 2013, the Ministry of Health and Health Sciences Authority issued
a joint guideline to announce the genotyping of the human leukocyte antigen
B gene’s 1502 allele (HLA-B*1502) prior to the initiation of carbamazepine
(CBZ) therapy in new patients of Asian ancestry as the standard of care.[3]</p>
<p>Dr Lo elaborated, “A strong association was discovered between the HLA-B*1502
allele and CBZ-induced Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis.
Hence, before starting new patients on CBZ, doctors need to test for the
HLA-B*1502 gene. This means waiting days to weeks for the return of test
results before starting therapy. It is not a long wait but it places extra
demands on clinics to trace test results, and follow up with patients on
whether they can commence their medications.”</p>
<p>“It’s worse if it is a drug-gene pair like tramadol and CYP2D6. The CYP2D6
gene affects the patient’s response to tramadol, a painkiller. But when
the patient is in great pain, it is tough to wait hours, let alone days
or weeks. With pre-emptive PGx testing, these issues can be addressed in
advance and relevant information can be made available at the point when
doctors adjust the drug doses. More importantly, we can reduce the incidences
of ADRs,” said Dr Lo.</p>
<p>Associate Professor Wee Hwee Lin, Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health,
National University of Singapore, said, “What’s more—when we reduce ADRs,
we are also reducing the economic burden arising from the associate costs
of ADRs. In a 2018 study conducted&nbsp;at&nbsp;the Singapore General Hospital,
we found that the total cost of 81 admissions caused by ADRs was S$770,0004.
Higher incremental laboratory costs were also incurred due to ADRs causing
or being present at admission.”</p>
<p><strong>A Guide for Optimising Prescriptions</strong>
</p>
<p>Availability of PGx testing results at the point of care can impact prescribing
decisions in a practical way. Even when patients are already taking drugs
which have&nbsp;<a href="https://cpicpgx.org/genes-drugs/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) Evidence level A or B</a>,
a substantial proportion of them would benefit from pre-emptive PGx testing.[5]&nbsp;“That
is because all drugs are developed for the average patient. But no two
patients are the same—every patient has an optimal dose that is different
from the other patient. So if we prescribe a drug according to its recommended
dosage to the whole population, we’ll see that only the average patient
will benefit from the prescription. Others get excessive toxicity or inefficacy,”
Prof Goh said.</p>
<p>Prof Goh continued, “The situation is more acutely felt in drugs with
narrow therapeutic windows. One example is the anti-coagulants that are
prescribed to prevent stroke. Underdosing the patient may cause another
stroke while overdosing may result in increased risk of bleeding. With
pre-emptive PGx testing, the goal is to help doctors select the best drug
with the most optimal dose so that patients do not lose a chance of response
or are subjected to toxicity that could have otherwise been prevented—and
yet enjoy the best therapeutic outcomes.”</p>
<p><strong>A Building Block for Population Health</strong>
</p>
<p>Despite the increasing accessibility of clinical grade PGx testing, the
PGx-guided prescribing approach in the current clinical ecosystem is highly
dependent on a number of factors. These include the attending clinicians’
knowledge of the required PGx tests, as well as their interpretation and
translation into therapeutic decisions for patients. Prof Goh said, “The
implementation of pre-emptive PGx testing into clinical practice is part
of the journey of this&nbsp;<a href="https://www.npm.sg/cip/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">clinical implementation pilot</a>&nbsp;(CIP)—and
its fruition hinges on engaging with different stakeholders to educate
them on benefits relevant and pertinent to them.”</p>
<p>Dr Lo said, “Yes—for instance, we try and show clinicians how PGx testing
can be a useful tool that helps them with their dosing while ensuring that
the process is seamless to their clinical practice. Then for patients,
we try to cover the grounds—from eliminating the logistics of having to
bring PGx results for consults to enjoying&nbsp;more efficacious therapeutics.”</p>
<p>“Cost is also an important consideration for patients. Fortunately, more
efficient equipment and workflows have made genotyping much more affordable
nowadays. Another advantage pre-emptive PGx testing has over the current
reactive single-gene approach is that the likelihood of having to repeat
it again in the future is low. With pre-emptive PGx testing, we are looking
at a multi-drug or multi-gene panel of about 30 drug-gene pairs. This covers
most of the knowledge today and possibly that of new arising drug-gene
pairs too,” A/Prof Wee said.</p>
<p>“To realise the full potential of pre-emptive PGx testing, we hope it
can involve large proportion of the population. But we recognise that we
are only at the beginning of this journey, and the team is assessing proactively
where an investment of time and effort will yield the greatest payoffs
and makes the most economic sense,” Prof Goh said.</p>

<p>[1] On average,&nbsp;patients admitted to SGH with ADRs stayed one day
longer than those without, translating to abot 9,400 extra hospital days
per year. Extrapolated to all of Singapore, this would be an additional
48,000 hospital days per year caused by ADRs.
