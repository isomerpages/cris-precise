<p>Besides cold winters and timeless architecture, Finland is also known
for one of the world’s leading genomic research projects—FinnGen. What
can the world learn from FinnGen?&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Launched in 2017, FinnGen began with the goal of improving health through
genetic research. FinnGen has collected and analysed genomic and health
data from 520,000 Finns to date—approximately 10% of the Finnish population.
It is now the largest such research project in Finland, and one of the
world’s leading biobank-based genomic research projects.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Delving into Finland’s Genetic Secrets</strong>&nbsp;</h4>
<p>At various points of history, the Finnish population experienced major
population bottlenecks—severe reductions in population size due to incidents
such as conflict, disease, famines and natural disasters. In addition,
Finland’s relatively isolated location meant that there was limited migration—contributing
to a genetically homogenous population. Put together—these qualities make
the Finnish population uniquely suitable for genetic study.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>As Professor Aarno Palotie, FinnGen’s Scientific Director, explained,
“Our small founder population has resulted in enriched genetic variants—some
of which have been associated with diseases. FinnGen has the potential
to offer shorter pathways to understanding the genetic mechanisms underlying
various conditions and diseases.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Due to Finland’s relatively homogeneous genetic makeup, Human Leukocyte
Antigen (HLA) imputation is also more accurate as compared to more diverse
populations—especially for genetic variants and disease-specific mutations.
Reconstruction of Finnish genomes can therefore be done using more inexpensive
genotype data, reducing the time and cost needed for research.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Researchers working with FinnGen’s data can also combine genomic data
with Finland’s comprehensive health registers—covering healthcare data
for all residents through their entire lives. This includes in- and outpatient
records, drug prescriptions and cause of death. As a result, the correlation
between genetics and health outcomes throughout a person’s life can be
better identified.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Nurturing Collaborations for Greater Impact</strong>&nbsp;</h4>
<p>In addition to leveraging the unique qualities of the Finnish population
genome, FinnGen was conceptualised as a public-private collaborative effort—involving
Finnish universities, research institutions, healthcare organisations,
biobanks and global pharmaceutical companies. Over the years—drawn in part
by the data-rich resource that FinnGen has become—more partners from both
public and private sectors have come onboard. At present, FinnGen is a
large-scale collaboration with over 30 partners.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Notably, the partnerships are often mutually beneficial. With the project’s
growing number of genetic discoveries, biobanks from across Finland—which
contributed participant data—have been able to share genetic insights with
participants. Prof Palotie said, “Based on our findings, the biobanks got
in touch and followed-up with participants at higher risk of specific diseases.
We are glad that many patients have expressed their appreciation for the
information.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Likewise for industry partners—“Our industry partners not only offer intellectual
and financial resources, but also a window into the pressing problems that
the industry is trying to solve,” Prof Palotie shared. This fulfils FinnGen’s
goals of facilitating drug discovery and improving population health—meanwhile
the pharmaceutical companies leverage FinnGen’s research findings to inform
decision-making for drug development.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>However, as Prof Palotie explained, helming such an extensive project
with multiple public-private involvement is a complicated affair. He said,
“Take the biobanks, for instance. They are located across Finland, each
facing local challenges and with differing data collection methods. Naturally,
what they want from our partnership vary.” Similar challenges abound with
partners from the private sector.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>To overcome these, Prof Palotie credits strong communication for getting
all partners on the same page to enable successful collaborations. “It’s
all about communication,” he said. “One thing Mark (Professor Mark Daly,
former Director of the Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland and one
of FinnGen’s key architects) and I do a lot is listen to our partners—finding
out what they expect from our collaboration, while having clear discussions
to keep expectations grounded.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Future Path to Genomic Breakthroughs</strong>&nbsp;</h4>
<p>These efforts have borne fruit—with FinnGen data driving research findings
across a wide range of conditions including cancers, cardiovascular diseases,
adverse drug reactions and mental disorders. Efforts to turn these findings
into clinical practice are also underway—such as incorporating genetic
factors into screening programmes for prostate and breast cancers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Having collected phenotype and genotype data of 520,000 Finnish individuals
over two phases, FinnGen entered its third phase—FinnGen 3—in August 2023.
While the first two phases (2017 to 2023) focused on building a resource
of genotype and phenotype data and analysing genetic associations, FinnGen
3 aims to further explore disease progression and biological mechanisms
underlying the diseases studied in the previous two phases.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Looking back on how far FinnGen has come since 2017, Prof Palotie reflected,
“Much of the project has turned out the way we envisioned. But the number
of discoveries uncovered—is much more than we ever dreamt.” Furthermore,
FinnGen has become a known biobank resource in genomic studies—with its
data tapped on for international research projects.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Prof Palotie said, “Today, FinnGen contributes to global projects and
findings—and I think this is an important development for us, because it’s
only through sharing data and results that we can move the field forward
and unearth meaningful discoveries for precision medicine.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
