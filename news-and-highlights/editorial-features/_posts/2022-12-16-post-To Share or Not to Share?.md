<p><em>Understanding public attitudes and ethical concerns surrounding health data sharing could inform governance strategies for national precision medicine programmes in Singapore.</em>
</p>
<p>On paper, the Care.data project proposed by England’s National Health
Service in 2013 should have been lauded as a step forward for healthcare.
The national central database of medical records would have served as a
rich repository of health data, potentially allowing for the development
of more effective medical treatments.</p>
<p>In reality, however, the programme was met with distrust from the public
over the lack of clear communication about how their health data would
be used or who it would be shared with. After much criticism, Care.data
was abandoned just three years later.</p>
<p>What happened with Care.data is a cautionary tale about the importance
of good communication and the need to understand public expectations around
sharing health data. The latter is particularly essential given that data-driven
initiatives typically operate on broad consent, which means participants
consent once to their data being used across an unspecified range of future
projects rather than consent being sought each time information is used
or shared.</p>
<p>Precision medicine, which aims to use genetic, health and lifestyle information
to provide patients with tailored diagnosis and treatment, adopts a similar
one-time broad consent framework for data collection. While precision medicine
may be the future of healthcare,&nbsp; advances in research and participation
in these programmes now rely upon their citizens’&nbsp; willingness to
share their personal health data. It is therefore more important than ever
to understand how people weigh the benefits and risks of data sharing.</p>
<h4><strong>A Balancing Act</strong></h4>
<p>Just as Asian genetics data are under-represented in public genomic databases,
so too are Asian perspectives and concerns surrounding the sharing of health
data, explained Assistant Professor Tamra Lysaght, Director of Research
and Phase Director of the Health Ethics, Law and&nbsp; Professionalism
programme at the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine at the Centre for Biomedical&nbsp;
Ethics, National University of Singapore. However, unravelling the views
of such an ethnically and culturally diverse region is no easy feat.</p>
<p>Lysaght and her team of bioethics researchers have made headway into this
enormous task by tapping into Singapore’s multi-ethnic population to gain
diverse views on Singaporean attitudes and ethical concerns towards health
data sharing for precision medicine initiatives. In a 2020&nbsp; study
published in&nbsp;<em>BMC Medical Ethics_1</em>,_&nbsp;the team documented
the results of seven focus groups conducted in English, Mandarin and Malay,
the country’s three major spoken languages.</p>
<p>Without prompting, the participants, most of whom held university degrees,
voiced sophisticated understandings of the trade-offs between the risks
and benefits of data sharing for precision medicine. Despite expressing
concerns about data breaches and misuse of sensitive information, most
participants were comfortable with the idea of sharing health data because
of the potential value to society and the ‘greater good,’ as they frequently
termed it.&nbsp;“The participants spontaneously started talking about the
constant risk of data breaches, and the inability to guarantee that the
data will never be inadvertently or deliberately leaked,”&nbsp; Lysaght
said. “However, they could also see a lot of good that can come from these&nbsp;
programmes.”</p>
<h4><strong>Who Watches the Watchdog?</strong></h4>
<p>Discussions about who the participants were willing to trust with their
health data were similarly nuanced. Recognising the potential value of
their work, participants held research and healthcare institutions in high
regard for handling health information. Insurance companies, on the other
hand, were largely seen as capable of misusing sensitive genetic data.</p>
<p>“Because precision medicine data involves genome sequencing data and potential
genetic susceptibility to diseases, there were a lot of concerns about
the data being used in ways that could be harmful to individuals,” Lysaght
explained.&nbsp;For data security, participants were particularly trusting
of government agencies, frequently mentioning the Ministry of Health. This
confidence in government, Lysaght said, contrasts with findings in other
countries.&nbsp;&nbsp;The team suggests that such attitudes may stem from
the Singaporean government’s swift and robust handling of prior data breaches,
like the unauthorised access to 1.6 million records at&nbsp; SingHealth
in 2018 and the leaking of more than 14,000 names on an HIV registry in
2019. They may also reflect the unique cultural norms and relationship
between Singapore’s population and government.</p>
<p>Despite this general trust, however, participants expressed some unease
that government agencies could still potentially misuse health data. To
counter this, they suggested that having an independent organisation that
oversees data sharing could further strengthen public trust in&nbsp; Singapore’s
precision medicine programme.&nbsp;Overall, the participants preferred
a multi-tiered strategy for data sharing. Such an approach could include
allowing participants to withdraw from precision medicine programmes, regulations
to restrict who can use the data and what the data can be used for, and
independent oversight. Furthermore, existing safeguards such as de-identified
data and only allowing trained personnel access to such data may also ensure
privacy preservation.</p>
<p>While more research is needed for ways to address the ethical and moral
concerns around data sharing in the region, Lysaght’s study provides important
initial insight that could help governments improve trust in precision
medicine programmes and bring about the real benefits of data-driven medical
research.</p>
