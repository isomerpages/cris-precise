<p>A sociological study finds that HELIOS, Singapore’s most comprehensive
and clinically-oriented biobank, lays the groundwork for using precision
medicine to tackle diseases of ageing.</p>
<p>Singapore is a rapidly ageing nation. Half of the population is over 42
years old, and in the next eight years, nearly a quarter of Singaporeans
will be at least 65 years of age and considered elderly1. Experts and the
Singapore government itself have long known that a greying population poses
increasingly urgent challenges to a country, particularly to its healthcare
system. After all, ageing is associated with several chronic conditions,
such as diabetes, osteoarthritis and various heart problems. As Singaporeans
grow older, these diseases and many others will become increasingly common
and pose a very real risk of overwhelming the country’s health system.</p>
<p><strong>Banking on data from 10,000 Singaporeans</strong>
</p>
<p>By combining molecular-level genetic information with a patient’s medical
history, lifestyle and family background, precision medicine could prove
to be a formidable tool to prevent and treat ageing-related diseases—many
of which have a genetic component.</p>
<p>However, such a data-intensive strategy first requires the establishment
of biobanks, extensive libraries of biological samples, patient data and
other information that can help researchers conduct studies that address
specific needs of the local population.</p>
<p>Realising the potential of precision medicine to tackle the problem of
ageing, Singapore’s Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine has initiated a large-scale
effort, called the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.healthforlife.sg/About_Helios" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Health for Life in Singapore study</a>,
better known by its acronym HELIOS. By collecting data from 10,000 Singaporeans,
HELIOS hopes to uncover genetic, environmental and lifestyle factors that
contribute to chronic diseases and develop innovative ways to manage these
conditions.</p>
<p>In a recent study2,&nbsp;<a href="https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/cris/rp/rp00308?ST_EMAILID=IANMCGONIGLE" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Ian McGonigle</a>,
Assistant Professor at the School of Social Sciences, Nanyang Technological
University, Singapore, examined HELIOS’ role in the country’s precision
medicine strategy to improve its healthcare system. With his colleagues
Manoj Vimal and Wairokpam Premi Devi, McGonigle found that more than just
dealing with the pressing challenges of an ageing population, HELIOS also
reflects important national principles and priorities.</p>
<p>“Respect and concern for the elderly is a very dominant cultural value
in Asia, particularly in Singapore,” he said, adding that biobanks in other
countries might instead focus on racial diversity or rare congenital diseases,
depending on what their needs may be. “Biobanks tell us a lot about the
nation’s culture.”</p>
<p><strong>HELIOS sets precision medicine in action</strong>
</p>
<p>McGonigle, who has spent several years studying biobanks from an anthropological
standpoint, explained that compared to some other biobanks around the world
that have more fundamental and different research aims, HELIOS is more
geared towards clinical and medical applications.</p>
<p>Aside from collecting the usual biological samples—blood, urine, saliva—HELIOS
puts participants through a comprehensive battery of physical tests, from
bone scans to lung assessments. HELIOS also checks participants’ cognitive
status and cardiovascular health, and conducts a complete physical and
laboratory work-up.</p>
<p>By directly linking Singaporeans’ genetic data with these clinical characteristics,
HELIOS allows doctors to identify which patients would be more likely to
develop arthritis or other conditions of old age.</p>
<p>“Ageing is unavoidable, but some diseases can be avoided,” said McGonigle.
“HELIOS is looking at diseases like obesity and diabetes. Some of these
conditions may have a genetic component, and work like HELIOS’s can help
identify individuals most at risk before they become ill.”</p>
<p>In turn, recommendations could be tailored according to patient risk profiles,
he noted. Those with a high propensity for diabetes, for example, could
be advised to keep healthier diets, while those at risk of arthritis could
follow stricter weight and exercise standards.</p>
<p>“This is what is so wonderful about precision medicine. Not all medical
problems require a high-tech solution and much of the population can go
a long way to avoid developing such diseases, just by making early-life
interventions in lifestyle,” McGonigle added.</p>
<p><strong>Boosting health for generations to come</strong>
</p>
<p>Beyond its practical applications, McGonigle and colleagues found that
HELIOS reveals the current prevailing cultural logic in Singapore, and
how the country hopes to navigate the waters of its own future.</p>
<p>“As an anthropologist, what was interesting to me about HELIOS was that
it was focusing quite explicitly, on the social issue of ageing and on
diseases of ageing,” McGonigle said. “This was interesting for me to learn
about, not only in terms of understanding the medical challenges for Singapore
but also in terms of how precision medicine is being marshalled for a generationally
focused purpose.”</p>
<p>Indeed, HELIOS and similar initiatives across the country fall in step
with Singapore’s concerted efforts to provide quality healthcare and promote
healthy lifestyles for its rapidly ageing populace—as well as the generations
that will follow it.</p>
<p>This foresight, combined with the unique application of precision medicine
in managing the country’s population cohort as a set of generations, is
what McGonigle and colleagues term “generational medicine.”</p>
<p>“By preparing for and anticipating the future, HELIOS can help people
in Singapore extend their lives and reduce the avoidable end-of-life suffering
and burden on their families. This is what we mean by generational medicine,”
he said.</p>
