<p><em>Understanding the public’s perception of the terms ‘personalised medicine’ and ‘precision medicine’ can help governments build more effective national precision medicine programmes.</em>
</p>
<p>The completion of the Human Genome Project in 2001 laid the groundwork
for a tailored approach to medicine—one where patients are diagnosed and
treated based on genetic, biological, environmental and lifestyle factors.
Now a burgeoning field, this paradigm is often known by two names: precision
medicine and personalised medicine.</p>
<p>While the terms precision and personalised medicine overlap, they have
subtle but important differences that may signal the goals and values of
policy makers. Initially adopted by the Human Genome Project and still
used by the European Union today, ‘personalised medicine’ implies individualised
care and treatment unique to each patient. ‘Precision medicine,’ on the
other hand, is used by other official bodies like Singapore’s Ministry
of Health (MOH) to emphasise that the initiative is based on subcategories
of patients grouped by risk of disease or response to interventions.</p>
<p>However, members of the public may interpret the two terms differently
than intended based on their cultural background and upbringing. This is
significant because how people perceive these terms can affect their acceptance
and willingness to contribute their data, which in turn can determine the
success of ventures like Singapore’s National Precision Medicine (NPM)
Programme.</p>
<p>On the larger scale, increasing participation is crucial to address the
underrepresentation of Asian populations in genomic studies and precision
medicine initiatives: although Asian populations make up roughly 60 percent
of the world population, just 14 percent of 2,511 genome-wide studies were
performed on those with Asian ancestry as of 2016.</p>
<h4><strong>Finding a Way with Words</strong></h4>
<p>Home to three of the main ethnic groups in Asia—Chinese, Malay and Indian—Singapore
is ideal for exploring possible connotations of the terms ‘personalised
medicine’ and ‘precision medicine’ in different ethnic groups. That about
73 percent of Singaporeans are bilingual also gives researchers like Serene
Ong, a PhD candidate at the National University of Singapore’s Centre for
Biomedical Ethics, the chance to explore how the terms translate in other
languages. Ong is part of a large team funded by a Social Science Research
Thematic Grant and MOH examining trustworthy governance for sharing health-related
data through a series of linked projects.</p>
<p>To learn the nuances of the two terms in different languages and the perspectives
of minority groups who primarily speak languages other than English, the
team recruited 24 ordinary Singaporeans to participate in focus groups
conducted in three of the country’s major spoken languages—English, Mandarin
and Malay.</p>
<p>A short initial discussion revealed that most of the participants were
not familiar with the term ‘precision medicine’. For instance, participants
in the Malay-speaking group had not heard of the term because the Malay
word for ‘precision’ (‘kepersisan’) used in the study is uncommon in itself.
Likewise, few participants in the English- and Mandarin-speaking group
recognised the term and were more familiar with ‘personalised medicine’
instead.</p>
<p>“While the term ‘precision medicine’ more accurately conveys the vision
of the NPM, there were some initial preferences for the term ‘personalised
medicine’ because it sounded more familiar,” Ong said. In contrast, the
participants felt that ‘precision medicine’ was more abstract and technical.</p>
<p>The researchers also noted that educational background could inform a
person’s field of expertise, which in turn influences how they perceive
certain terms. For example, participants with engineering and chemistry
backgrounds would likely associate the term ‘precision’ with how well two
or more measurements agree with each other — a clear difference from the
definition of ‘precision medicine.’</p>
<p>According to Ong, the ambiguity surrounding the term ‘precision’ highlights
the need to use clear and comprehensible communications when implementing
the NPM. “It is important that public communications are reliable, relatable
and digestible, and where possible, create dialogue with community rather
than a unilateral flow of information from the experts to the public,”
she said.</p>
<h4><strong>Learn by Watching</strong></h4>
<p>In today’s technology-driven society, it is not uncommon for novices to
learn new concepts and skills through informational videos, typically found
online. Even short videos can be effective in introducing seemingly complex
topics to an audience encountering the subject for the first time.</p>
<p>The team found this to be the case in their study. After sharing their
initial thoughts, the participants were shown a five-minute video to introduce
them to the concept of precision medicine and programmes like the NPM.
Without using either of the terms ‘personalised medicine’ or ‘precision
medicine,’ the video promoted a shift in the preferences of participants
in all three groups towards the latter term.</p>
<p>Through the video, participants were able to gain a clearer understanding
of the concepts and goals of precision medicine, leading many to acknowledge
that the term ‘precision medicine’ more accurately described the approach.
While some still personally preferred ‘personalised medicine,’ most participants
did not seem to have a strong preference for either term.</p>
<p>Although the researchers did not set out to assess the effectiveness of
their video, it proved to be an effective educational intervention. In
addition to easing unfamiliarity on precision medicine, the video also
prompted discussion about the drawbacks of the underrepresentation of Asian
populations in genetics data. Bringing such issues to light will further
efforts to diversify genomics research.</p>
<p>“The lack of understanding about technical terms can be overcome with
clear and transparent communications that invite diverse communities to
engage in dialogue with researchers and policymakers about the ultimate
goals and purpose of the NPM, and how it can benefit all Singaporeans now
and in the future,” Ong concluded.</p>
