<p>Metabolic diseases like diabetes are on the rise globally, but in Asia,
the challenge is especially urgent—and complex. In countries like Singapore,
where Chinese, Malay and Indian people live side by side, it's become increasingly
clear that diabetes doesn't affect everyone in the same way. In fact, studies
have shown that diabetes is nearly four times as prevalent in Malay and
Indian communities compared to Chinese.</p>
<p>“These are big differences in diabetes risk between Singapore's communities.
If you were to put that in terms of a simple measure like height, it’s
as though you are looking at a group that was four times taller” said Professor
John Chambers, President’s Chair in Cardiovascular Epidemiology at the
Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine (LKCMedicine), Nanyang Technological
University (NTU), and Chief Scientific Officer of PRECISE. “It’s surprising,
and important for us to understand, why groups of people living in Singapore
have such different health outcomes.”</p>
<p>While the difference in health is clear, the reasons why are much less
obvious. In recent years, visceral adiposity—fat stored deep within the
abdomen and nestled against internal organs—has emerged as a key suspect.
Unlike subcutaneous fat, which lies just under the skin and is linked more
to long-term adaptations to cold environments, visceral fat is highly metabolically
active and has been strongly linked to insulin resistance, high blood pressure
and abnormal cholesterol levels.</p>
<p>Yet the common clinical measure of obesity, the body mass index (BMI),
is a poor measure of visceral fat. As a result, BMI overlooks a pattern
common in Asians—high visceral fat despite low body weight. This “thin
outside, fat inside” profile is frequently seen in Asian type 2 diabetes
patients, highlighting the need for more tailored, population-specific
assessments.</p>
<p>A team of researchers led by Dr Theresia Mina, a Dean’s Postdoctoral Fellow
at LKCMedicine, used dual X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) to investigate the
role of visceral fat and metabolic diseases in Singapore. Unlike BMI, which
is a simple ratio of weight to height squared, DEXA scans can measure where
fat is stored and distinguish between visceral and subcutaneous fat. Their
results have been published in <em><a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S2213-8587(24)00195-5" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">The Lancet Diabetes &amp; Endocrinology</a></em>.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>An Answer, and a New Question</strong></h4>
<p>As part of the <a href="https://www.healthforlife.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Health for Life in Singapore (HELIOS) study,</a> a
preparatory study for our larger SG100K initiative, over 9,000 Singaporeans
had their body composition assessed by DEXA and compared against key metabolic
indicators such as insulin sensitivity, blood lipid levels and blood pressure.
The researchers found that excess visceral fat strongly correlated with
poor metabolic health and nearly fully explained the differences between
triglyceride levels and blood pressure when comparing Chinese and Malay
participants. However, it only partially explained the differences in diabetes
status between Chinese and Indian participants. “Even when we took into
account well-recognised risk factors such as body mass, body composition
and visceral fat localisation, there remained substantial differences in
risk of diabetes that are unexplained,” Prof Chambers said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This dual finding presents both clarity and mystery. On one hand, the
study provides conclusive evidence that visceral fat is a major driver
of metabolic dysfunction. On the other hand, it also raises a new question
of what then explains the higher risk of diabetes in Indian populations
compared to Chinese ones. “There is still an unsolved disease mechanism
that urgently needs to be understood and a health inequity that demands
a solution,” Prof Chambers said.</p>
<p>One possible mechanism that the team is currently investigating is epigenetics,
where environmental factors influence the way genes are expressed rather
than alter the genes themselves. “The hypothesis is that metabolic programming¾our
early life trajectory, breastfeeding or not, patterns of nutrition or physical
activity that were set up in early childhood¾these factors might account
for the remaining differences we have observed,” said Prof Chambers. “What
is nice about that is that if it is due to early life metabolic programming,
then it is a fixable problem. We can identify these early life exposures
that are putting people on different trajectories and it becomes a readily
addressable public health issue, unlike genetics, which cannot be changed.”</p>
<h4><strong>Turning Diversity into Discovery</strong></h4>
<p>The study provides direction for both patient care and public health.
Firstly, it underlines the need for more tailored public health strategies.
“This paper shows that it is really important to appreciate the differences
across ethnic groups—that there is different metabolic burden,” said Dr
Mina. “One way to move forward would be to perhaps consider different cut-off
values for different ethnic groups for health screening in Singapore as
well as globally,” she added.</p>
<p>Another strength of the study, according to Prof Chambers, is its precision.
“We can be pretty definite about the magnitude of these relationships,
the importance of visceral fat as a contributor to metabolic problems in
the Malay ethnic group, and also the extent to which it's contributory
in Singaporeans of Indian descent,” he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This study is just one of the early striking findings coming out of the
HELIOS study, which is part of the SG100K study of 100,000 participants
across Singapore’s multi-ethnic population, drawing from people from all
walks of life and across the social, economic and health spectrum. By collecting
deeply phenotyped, high-quality data representative of the diverse Singaporean
population, SG100K has enabled researchers to detect patterns that would
have otherwise remained hidden.</p>
<p>In the next phase, the study will be further enriched with electronic
health care records and molecular data on metabolites, proteins and RNA
species, in addition to the baseline genetic data. “So this study is just
a first glimpse of the power of precision medicine,” Prof Chambers said.</p>
<p>But the ambition doesn’t stop there. The goal is to take the Asia-specific
findings from the study and place them alongside international datasets
in a larger global context, and in so doing understand the Singaporean
data more deeply while also contributing to a truly global understanding
of health. Ultimately, the work reflects a growing commitment to a more
equitable and effective form of medicine—one that recognises diversity
not as a complication, but as a key to understanding and solving complex
health problems.</p>
