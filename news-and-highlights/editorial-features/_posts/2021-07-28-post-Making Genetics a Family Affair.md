<p><em>It’s not true that genomic sequencing has relegated</em>&nbsp;<em>family history taking</em>&nbsp;<em>to the backseat in health risk assessments. In fact,</em>&nbsp;<em>comprehensive family history data can complement genomic analysis and advance precision medicine.</em>
</p>
<p>When it comes to defining what family means, it’s all relative. Around
the world, familial relationships can have different connotations. Consider
the case of Singapore, where the terms ‘aunty’ and ‘uncle’ do not simply
refer to the siblings of one’s parents, as in most Western cultures, but
are also used to respectfully address elders in the community. In medicine,
however, ‘family’ universally refers to individuals related by blood, with
whom you share your genes—and, thus, your propensity for disease.</p>
<p>Family history has long been used by clinicians to assess health risk,
and forms a major component of risk assessment guidelines for many conditions.
Recently, its value has been questioned and its use minimised in screening
populations as genomic sequencing has evolved to become the go-to screening
method. Further fuelling this change is the fact that in some studies 48
to 75 percent of individuals found to harbour a disease-related genetic
variant have no family history of the disease in question.</p>
<h4><strong>Taking History Online</strong></h4>
<p>Today, the decision to note down family history largely depends on how
the data is collected. Traditionally, the process could be laborious and
time-consuming, involving emailing questionnaires to participants, who
are entrusted to collect the relevant information from their family members.
Given the self-reporting nature of the process, information is often incomplete
or non-specific, posing difficulties in interpretation.</p>
<p>Fortunately, interactive web-based tools that can simplify this process
are becoming widely available. One example is&nbsp;<a href="https://precisionmedicine.duke.edu/researchers/precision-medicine-programs/risk-assessment/family-history/metree-software" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">MeTree</a>,
a web-based, patient-facing family history collection and clinical decision
support tool developed by Lori Orlando and Geoffrey Ginsburg of Duke University,
US. MeTree creates a pedigree of at least three generations for a range
of health conditions, and its interactive platform prompts participants
to enter additional details should there be any key questions they may
have missed.</p>
<p>These features can improve the quality of data and produce more comprehensive
health history records. “A study in which our group was involved found
that using a web-based family history collection tool such as MeTree increased
the level of detail of data collected, thereby increasing the detection
of inherited health risks for participants,” said Patrick Tan, Executive
Director of the Institute of Precision Medicine (PRISM) and Precision Health
Research Singapore (PRECISE).</p>
<h4><strong>Complementing Cancer Genetics</strong></h4>
<p>Despite these improvements, the question remains: does family history
remain relevant in the genomics era? To address this, Tan and his colleagues
at PRISM collaborated with Duke University researchers to assess the value
of using family history collected through MeTree to identify individuals
most likely to benefit from genomic screening. Since certain types of cancer
run in families and several genes already have established links to the
disease, the team explored the relationship between cancer risk—as determined
through family history—and the presence of clinically significant genomic
variants.</p>
<p>Specifically, the study compared the detection of pathogenic variants
in 95 cancer genes in 1,750 Singaporean participants with and without a
family history available through MeTree. “Our study found that participants
who had an increased risk of cancer according to their family history were
six times more likely to carry a genetic variant associated with a cancer
syndrome in comparison to those who did not report a significant family
history of cancer,” said first author Yasmin Bylstra, Principal Genetic
Counsellor at PRISM.</p>
<p>Sometimes, however, the data didn’t add up. In less than 10 percent of
cases, family history and genetic results were inconsistent&nbsp; —with
no detectable cancer variant despite a family history indicating increased
risk. Consequently, these patients still require cancer surveillance recommendations
according to their family history findings, which may have been missed
if only genomic sequencing had been performed.</p>
<p>This means that family history may in fact complement genetic testing
by identifying people who are more likely to benefit from genomic sequencing,
noted Bylstra. Given that a genetic test can cost over S$1,000 per patient
for whole genome sequencing, using family history as a triaging method
to select at-risk individuals may be cost-effective.</p>
<p><strong>Population-level impact</strong>
</p>
<p>Within their study cohort, the researchers found that 8.4 percent of individuals
with family history data had an increased risk of developing cancer. While
it may seem like a small number, such a statistic should not be overlooked
by Singapore’s 5.7 million residents. “Extrapolated to the population-level,
this would equate to a significant proportion of Singaporeans at increased
risk of developing cancer who could potentially be unaware,” Tan said.</p>
<p>While their initial research focused on cancer, the team wants to include
more participants and assess the risk of other inheritable conditions,
such as cardiac, metabolic and haematological diseases, noted Tan. Similar
to the current study, the family history for these conditions can be assessed
through MeTree.</p>
<p>Despite the increasing adoption of genomic sequencing in clinical care,
it is apparent that family histories remain a critical component of health
risk assessment. Not only can they inform individuals of their risk of
developing inherited medical conditions, but family histories also allows
clinicians to recommend optimal screening methods for patients—advancing
national strategies for precision and prevention medicine in Singapore
and around the world.</p>
