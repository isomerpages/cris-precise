<h4><strong>From Fruit Fly Scientist to Founder of a Biotech Start-up</strong></h4>
<p><em>Spurred by his desire to impact human health, Professor Liu Jianjun reflects on his career in precision medicine, which has recently been recognised with the 2020 President’s Science Award.</em>
</p>
<hr>
<p>The fields of genetics and genomics have exploded since the landmark Human
Genome Project began in 1990. Technological developments and falling costs
have made population genetics endeavours more feasible, and numerous such
studies have been initiated. Now, the focus is turning to deciphering our
genes to identify those that are important for health and disease, a feat
that will ultimately enable clinicians to more accurately predict a patient’s
risk for disease and to tailor treatments for more successful outcomes.</p>
<p>A key name in the effort to bring human genetics research to the clinic
in Singapore is Professor Liu Jianjun, Deputy Executive Director of A*STAR’s&nbsp;
<a href="https://www.a-star.edu.sg/gis" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Genome Institute of Singapore (GIS)</a>. In December 2020, Liu was awarded
the President’s Science Award (PSA), one of Singapore’s highest honours
given to scientists and engineers. His work on the genetics of Asian populations—currently
grossly underrepresented in public research databases —has and continues
to contribute to advancing medical research and the field of precision
medicine at large.</p>
<p>Here, Liu discusses his interest in genetics, the impact of the research
that contributed to his winning the PSA, and his plans going forward.</p>
<h4><strong>What drew you to study human genetics and to make it your life’s work?</strong></h4>
<p>For my PhD candidature at Duke University, I studied classical genetics,
which uses genetics to understand species evolution. I used&nbsp;<em>Drosophila</em>,
or the fruit fly, as a model. I remember, at one point, my mum asked me
what I was studying. When she heard about the fruit flies, her response
was, “Why are you studying that?”. That was when I realised that while
fruit fly genetics and species evolution were interesting subjects for
a doctorate thesis, it was somewhat removed from the lives of humans. So,
for my postdoctoral research at Columbia University, I switched to studying
human genetics, to try to have a more direct impact on human health.</p>
<h4><strong>One of the</strong>&nbsp;<strong>accomplishments that contributed to your winning the PSA was the identification of risk strains of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and its association with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Can you share the story behind this discovery?</strong></h4>
<p>EBV has long been linked to NPC: it is one of the few viruses known to
cause cancer in men; EBV is always found in patients’ tumour tissues. EBV
infection is endemic and it is present in more than 90% of the world’s
population, yet only &nbsp;a small percentage of the world’s population
developed NPC, and only in a particular geographical region; NPC has a
higher prevalence in southern compared to northern China. We now know that
the answer came down to genetics: like other viruses, EBV has different
strains.</p>
<p>To draw better connections between EBV and how it causes NPC, we performed
large-scale whole genome sequencing of many EBV strains and examined samples
from different regions to determine whether a specific strain of EBV could
be responsible for NPC. We found two strains in southern China that were
so strong that a person carrying both strains is ten times more likely
to develop NPC than the normal population. Our modelling analysis showed
that these strains explained 80% of the risk of developing NPC in southern
China.</p>
<p>This understanding has opened many clinical opportunities for applications
to healthcare that may impact the lay person. For example, we are working
on developing a screening programme to identify individuals carrying these
EBV strains. Once identified, these affected individuals can be referred
to specialists and followed up regularly at the clinics. This in turn allows
for early diagnosis of NPC. Early stage NPC has a good survival rate of
up to 95%, whereas the survival rate for late stage NPC (e.g. at stage
three or four ) is dismal, at less than 50%. Therefore, early diagnosis
is critical for NPC, but unfortunately, most NPC patients are currently
diagnosed with late stage cancer. By enabling early diagnosis, our discovery
can really transform the clinical management of NPC.</p>
<h4><strong>Your work on dapsone sensitivity has also had enormous impact. Can you tell us about this study?</strong></h4>
<p>This study forms a line of research called pharmacogenomics. For a long
time, we have known that people respond differently to drug treatments,
yet current clinical practice treats everyone the same. In the case of
dapsone—a very effective treatment for leprosy—about 10–15% of patients
develop fatal adverse drug reactions, known as dapsone hypersensitivity
syndrome, or DHS. And doctors could not tell who would or would not develop
DHS.</p>
<p>I performed a genetics study and identified a factor called HLA-B*13:01,
which increases an individual’s risk of developing DHS by 30-fold. My students
and I have now founded Nalagenetics, a startup, to take this finding related
to dapsone from an academic setting into the commercial space. Through
Nalagenetics, we are also working with the Indonesian Ministry of Health
to establish a national screening programme, as Indonesia ranks among the
top three countries with the highest rates of leprosy in the world. I think
genetics and genomics can play a large role in the future of precision
medicine. I hope that Nalagenetics will continue to develop more diagnostic
tests and contribute to the precision medicine effort in Singapore.</p>
<h4><strong>What does winning the PSA mean to you and what do you hope to do next?</strong></h4>
<p>I see it as recognition of the impact of genetics on biomedical research.
I think my work truly demonstrates how genetics can help advance our understanding
of disease and also our response to treatment.</p>
<p>Moving forward, there are two main areas where I want to specifically
focus my efforts on. The first is the National Precision Medicine program,
where I will contribute through my role as the Deputy Executive Director
of GIS. The second is related to my academic research. There are still
questions I would like to pursue in my NPC/EBV research, particularly related
to how recent strains of EBV have evolved in the population. I also want
to further my work in cancer genetics.</p>
