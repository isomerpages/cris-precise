<hr>
<p>Every living creature on earth carries in their DNA the instructions to
make each one unique. Yet despite the diversity we see, all human beings
are remarkably similar at the genetic level— up to 99.9 percent according
to the Human Genome Project1. However, the remaining 0.1 percent makes
a world of difference, and is responsible for variation that can include
one’s predisposition to certain diseases or how they respond to treatment.</p>
<p>Traditionally, medical treatment has been based on a “one-size-fits-all
approach,” which prescribes standardised treatments to all patients based
on clinical history and symptoms. However, studies have established that
patients will experience varied benefits or side effects to treatment,
depending on their genetic makeup2.</p>
<p>A precision medicine approach considers these individual genetic variations
along with environmental and lifestyle factors to ensure more accurate
medical treatments, and so requires large amounts of data. In the earthquake-stricken
Tohoku region of Japan, the Tohoku Medical Megabank (TMM) Project was established
to help restore and improve healthcare and at the same time, collect a
large biobank of biological specimens from the region’s residents.</p>
<p>As one of TMM’s founders, Professor Masayuki Yamamoto has dedicated the
past decade of his research career to establishing precision medicine in
Japan. Here, he shares his motivations for spearheading the Tohoku Medical
Megabank Organization (ToMMo) and for championing the use of precision
medicine to improve healthcare where it is needed most.</p>
<h4><strong>1. Can you tell us a bit about yourself and your work in precision medicine?</strong></h4>
<p>I graduated from Tohoku University School of Medicine in 1979 with an
M.D. and Graduate School of Medicine in 1983 with a Ph.D. I worked as a
postdoctoral fellow at Northwestern University in the United States of
America under Professor Doug Engel for more than four years. When I revisited
the Engel laboratory in 1989, we collaborated on a project in which we
identified the GATA family of transcription factors, some of the most important
transcription factors regulating gene expression.</p>
<p>In 1991, I returned to Japan and continued studying the&nbsp;<em>GATA1</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>GATA2</em>&nbsp;genes.
Since then, I have worked on various projects addressing critical questions
related to gene expression regulations. My current research interests include
transcription factors, oxidative stress response, hematopoietic differentiation
and genetically modified mice.</p>
<p>Currently, our focus is on translating some of our research findings in
animal models from over the years to human health with precision medicine
in mind. On that note, we have been working to establish a biobank that
recruits large population cohorts and establish precision medicine in Japan.</p>
<h4><strong>2. You established the TMM as part of the Tohoku Medical Megabank</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Organization.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Why is the biobank important to you?</strong></h4>
<p>The Great East Japan Earthquake of March 2011 caused unprecedented damage,
with nearly 18,000 casualties. At the time, I was the Dean of the School
of Medicine at Tohoku University. We decided to work on an immediate rescue
project to help rebuild the community and spent months reconstructing the
tsunami-devastated area with the help of the government.</p>
<p>We conceptualised the Tohoku Medical Megabank (TMM) biobank as a cutting-edge
project to deliver the most advanced medicine to earthquake and tsunami
survivors, and launched it in February 2012. Through the TMM biobank, we
aim to establish an advanced medical system to foster the reconstruction
of the tsunami-devastated area. We envisage personalised medicine and healthcare
to be the most advanced medicine we could provide.</p>
<h4><strong>3. What are some of the benefits of the TMM biobank?</strong></h4>
<p>The biobank has become a mutually beneficial project. Through this project,
we helped reconstruct the community’s health and welfare by rebuilding
the Tohoku area’s medical system while the residents living and working
in that area participated in the TMM cohort studies.</p>
<p>Since then, the organisation has assembled a large biobank that combines
medical and genome information. The information from the biobank has created
an advanced medical system that supports the establishment of precision
medicine in Japan. Based on its magnitude, the TMM now attracts medical
practitioners and experts from all over the country, promoting industry-academic
partnerships and creating employment in related fields.</p>
<h4><strong>4. What excites you about precision medicine and its potential in clinical applications?</strong></h4>
<p>Some of our work has shown that genetic and environmental factors, such
as air pollutants, activate the genetic mechanism resulting in atopic dermatitis
in mice. Using the TMM Birth and Three-Generation Cohort Study, research
is now underway to investigate the connection between environmental factors
such as traffic smoke and atopic dermatitis.</p>
<p>The work to see how the findings from mouse studies will translate into
a better understanding and treatment of human diseases is truly exciting,
because analyses of genetic and environmental factors are critical for
clarifying disease progression and treatment options.</p>
