<p><em>By using emerging gene editing techniques to modify and engineer DNA, Dr Chew Wei Leong and his team at the Genome Institute of Singapore are imagining a world without disease.</em>
</p>
<hr>
<p>Dr Chew Wei Leong, Group Leader and Associate Director at A*STAR’s Genome
Institute of Singapore (GIS),&nbsp;has one goal: to rewrite the human genome.&nbsp;It
sounds ambitious, but emerging technologies are making gene editing — or
the act of adding, removing, or altering particular parts of an organism’s
DNA — possible. Doing so allows scientists to develop gene therapies that
can treat diseases that were previously thought to be incurable.</p>
<p>In 2016, Dr Chew provided one of the first demonstrations of multi-organ
gene editing and genetic disease correction in mice using CRISPR. Initially
discovered in bacteria, CRISPR has generated much excitement within the
scientific community because it is more versatile, fast, and affordable
than other genome editing techniques—thereby opening the door for exactly
the type of research Dr Chew and his team have set out to do.</p>
<p>Since then, Dr Chew has accumulated more than 20 patents and technology
disclosures in the field of gene editing, gene therapy, and nucleic acid
technologies. His team’s research currently covers genome editing, immunology,
and gene therapy. They develop technologies that allow for pinpoint alteration
of specific genes, delivery of treatments and, ultimately, saving lives.</p>
<p>In this interview, Dr Chew talks about developing the cure for genetic
disorders, rewriting the blueprint of life, and what these developments
mean for Singapore.</p>
<h4><strong><em>Why should Singapore be excited about research on gene editing and CRISPR from a healthcare angle?</em></strong></h4>
<p>Gene editing is precision surgery on our genomes. This means that genes
with mutations that cause diseases could be corrected to the healthy versions
within the patients.</p>
<p>Using these new technological breakthroughs, we can now develop therapeutics
that permanently cure genetic disorders at the root cause: the gene level.
This is an entirely new way to treat and cure diseases, including previously
incurable ones, with important implications for patients in Singapore and
globally.</p>
<h4><strong><em>On your website, you describe your work as “Rewriting Life”. What research work is the Chew Lab currently focusing on?</em></strong></h4>
<p>Our technologies rewrite DNA, the blueprint of life. In editing DNA, we
change how our cells and body function. Gene editing has a universal impact
on other lifeforms, not just in therapeutic benefits for humans. Gene editing
technology is already impacting diverse human activities, such as agriculture,
manufacturing, and environmental control.</p>
<p>Our lab at the Genome Institute of Singapore develops technologies for
gene editing, nucleic acid therapeutics, and synthetic biology. Our mission
is to make DNA-writing routine medicine for patients at the clinic.</p>
<h4><strong><em>Can you share with us highlights of some research projects geared towards establishing safe and effective genome therapeutics?</em></strong></h4>
<p>We have extensive research experience in understanding the safety profiles
of gene editing therapeutics, especially through how our immune system
responds to the therapy. Through our work and that of our colleagues, we
now know that the most promising gene therapy and gene editing therapy
approaches induce strong immune responses that pose safety risks. Importantly,
our work has shown that engineered therapeutics can evade these immune
responses, allowing many people to benefit from these game-changing medicines.</p>
<p>For more than a decade, we have been on this journey to develop gene editing
therapeutics, starting from early predecessors of the gene editing technology
such as zinc finger nucleases and TALENs, and subsequently pioneering work
in CRISPR-Cas9 technologies. These early successes have built solid foundations
for many contemporary therapeutic pipelines, but we continue to innovate
in the next generation of technology. Some exciting work involves our base
editor technology which allows us to precisely change one letter in the
genome to another; gene delivery vectors, which sends the therapeutics
precisely into the desired cell targets; and molecular technologies, which
enables new and more sophisticated genome engineering applications.</p>
<h4><strong><em>Has any of the research been translated to bedside clinical applications?</em></strong></h4>
<p>Despite their enormous promise, gene editing technologies are still emerging,
and clinical trials have only just begun globally. Data from multiple clinical
trials have shown promising cures in patients suffering from cancers and
blood disorders. We are optimistic that rigorous preclinical studies and
clinical trials will soon bring safe and efficacious therapeutics to patients.</p>
<h4><strong><em>What is your vision for Chew Lab from the perspective of Singapore’s National Precision Medicine Programme?</em></strong></h4>
<p>We are extremely excited to understand the genomics of our Singaporean
population via the NPM Programme led by Precision Health Research, Singapore
(PRECISE). From this valuable knowledge, we would begin the journey of
developing groundbreaking therapeutics for genetic diseases that are prevalent
in Singaporeans. This would be one of the many impressive health benefits
of the NPM Programme to our people.</p>
