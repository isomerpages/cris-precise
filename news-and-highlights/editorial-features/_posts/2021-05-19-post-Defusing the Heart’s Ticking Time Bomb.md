<h4><strong>It may be commonly inherited and potentially life-threatening, but familial hypercholesterolemia remains an</strong>&nbsp;<strong>underdiagnosed</strong>&nbsp;<strong>and</strong>&nbsp;<strong>undertreated</strong>&nbsp;<strong>condition. Precision medicine could change that.</strong></h4>
<hr>
<p>Mei Yen was just 21 when she started getting occasional chest pains. At
the time, she still thought of cardiovascular disease as an affliction
that only pertained to the old and overweight. Nevertheless, a history
of heart problems in the family prompted her to go for a check-up. The
results turned out to be a terrible surprise: at 400mg/dL, Mei Yen’s cholesterol
level was exceptionally high and more than twice the recommended level.</p>
<p>“I was very shocked because I was in the prime of my life,” Mei Yen, now
a mother of two young girls, recounted in a video for the Singapore Heart
Foundation. “[The doctor] told me that I was basically a walking time bomb.
It didn’t occur to me that this would happen to me.”</p>
<p>Following her check-up, Mei Yen was diagnosed with familial hypercholesterolemia,
an inherited genetic condition that causes elevated cholesterol levels
in otherwise healthy individuals, thereby increasing their risk of early
heart disease. Today, she is on statin medication, which helps lower her
cholesterol levels. She also watches her diet carefully and gyms three
times a week; the drugs, combined with better lifestyle habits, enable
her to continue staying healthy for her children.</p>
<h4><strong>An Invisible Killer</strong></h4>
<p>Half of all people whose parents have familial hypercholesterolemia end
up inheriting the condition themselves. In Mei Yen’s case, it was her father
who had had elevated cholesterol levels, caused by a genetic mutation.</p>
<p>Our genes are short fragments of DNA that carry a set of instructions
for our cells to perform different functions. Sometimes, however, genes
undergo mutations that alter their instruction-giving abilities. In the
case of familial hypercholesterolemia, the LDLR gene that contains instructions
responsible for clearing ‘bad cholesterol’ is defective. Over time, this
‘bad cholesterol,’ which is also known as low density lipoprotein (LDL),
begins to accumulate and clog the walls of the arteries.</p>
<p>Due to such vascular blockages, patients with familial hypercholesterolemia
face an increased risk of cardiovascular events such as heart attacks or
strokes long before they even reach middle age. Despite the severe consequences,
familial hypercholesterolemia remains one of the most common yet underdiagnosed
and undertreated conditions in the world. Globally, the disease affects
over 34 million people and powerful drugs exist that can effectively control
it, yet close to 90 percent of people do not know they have familial hypercholesterolemia
until it is too late—when a heart attack has already struck, or when serious
medical intervention is required. In some cases, familial hypercholesterolemia
is also misdiagnosed as high blood pressure or high cholesterol, with devastating
consequences for patients and their families.</p>
<h4><strong>Detecting Undiagnosed Diseases</strong></h4>
<p>For patients, the good news is that not every story has to end in tragedy.
Effective drugs, such as Mei Yen’s statin medication, can lower LDL cholesterol
levels by 50 percent or more. All that is needed for doctors to prescribe
them is a clear diagnosis.</p>
<p>Currently, a quick blood test and knowledge of family history can diagnose
familial hypercholesterolemia at an early stage, a diagnosis that can be
confirmed by genetic testing. When it comes to familial hypercholesterolemia,
defective LDLR genes are only the tip of the genetic mutation iceberg.
Variations in protein-producing genes such as APOB or PCSK9 may also hinder
the efficient removal of LDL from the bloodstream, leading to the same
condition of inherited, elevated cholesterol levels.</p>
<p>This approach of taking into account a person’s family history, genes
and lifestyle behaviour to predict, diagnose and treat diseases is called
precision medicine. Apart from early diagnosis, precision medicine could
also help scientists to compare individuals with familial hypercholesterolemia,
and ultimately deduce more of these genetic variants that cause disease.
Early detection of these defective genes would go a long way in diagnosing
and treating familial hypercholesterolemia, and make a world of difference
for patients and their families.</p>
<h4><strong>Prevention is Better than Cure</strong></h4>
<p>Familial hypercholesterolemia is just one example of an inherited disease
that precision medicine can help to diagnose and treat. Through cutting-edge
technologies such as whole genome sequencing and artificial intelligence-driven
data analysis, precision healthcare professionals can go a step further
and prevent certain diseases from developing in the first place. By tapping
on genetic, environmental and lifestyle data, they are able to identify
patients at risk of conditions such as diabetes and even cancer before
their early onset, allowing doctors to focus on prevention rather than
cure.</p>
<p>With Singapore’s SG100K project to sequence genomes and collect phenotypic
and lifestyle data from 100,000 participants well underway, researchers
and doctors will not only be able to draw links between genotypes, genetic
variation, and disease but also look at more complex factors such as gene
regulation, gene expression, and protein synthesis—and how individual behaviour
and lifestyle choices may lead to the development of specific health conditions.</p>
<p>Receiving a diagnosis of inherited diseases such as familial hypercholesterolemia
might leave patients feeling hopeless, as there is nothing they can do
to change their genetics. But by arming these same patients with knowledge
of their condition through early diagnoses, precision medicine can free
them to make lifestyle and treatment choices that change their medical
fates.</p>
