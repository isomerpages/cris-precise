<p>Primary care physicians or General Practitioners in Singapore are often the first point of contact for patients seeking medical advice, diagnosis and treatment for common illnesses and health concerns. They also establish a relationship of trust with their patients, and often care for more than one member of the family.</p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Resources/Events/240114_fpsc_09.jpg"></div><p>As Singapore shifts its healthcare system’s focus from reactive treatment to preventive care, the emerging field of genomic medicine has the potential to transform healthcare for improved population health. With an individual’s genomic information, clinicians can not only assess health risks, but also stratify disease, guide clinical care, and provide a continuum of care for the wellness of patients. <br><br>In collaboration with the Ministry of Health’s College of Family Physicians Singapore and the National Cancer Centre Singapore, PRECISE co-organised a <strong>clinical primer on genomic medicine for primary care physicians</strong> on 13 and 14 January 2024.</p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Resources/Events/240114_fpsc_01.jpg"></div><p><strong>More than 110 clinicians attended the inaugural course</strong>, where they were introduced to the <strong>principles of clinical genetics</strong>, as well as the <strong>important role they can play in improving patient access to clinical genomics</strong>.</p><p>They also gained insights into <strong>how to co-manage patients with genetic health professionals </strong>(such as genetic counsellors), and <strong>support patients and their caregivers in making complex decisions</strong>.</p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Resources/Events/240114_fpsc_03.jpg"></div><p>The lead investigators of PRECISE’s <a href="/cip" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">clinical implementation pilots</a> discussed how their respective projects are studying the integration of genetic testing into clinical workflows:</p><ul data-tight="true" class="tight"><li><p><strong>Hereditary and familial cancer disposition </strong>by A/Prof Joanne Ngeow</p></li><li><p><strong>Understanding Familial Hypercholesterolemia</strong> by Dr Tavintharan Subramaniam</p></li><li><p><strong>Importance of genetic testing in kidney disease</strong> by A/Prof Ng Kar Hui and and Dr Chan Gek Cher</p></li><li><p><strong>Pharmacogenomics in a nutshell for family physicians</strong> by Dr Elaine Lo</p></li><li><p><strong>Polygeneic risk scores: when should we use them?</strong> by Dr Li Jingmei</p></li></ul><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Resources/Events/240114_fpsc_06.jpg"></div><p>Speakers also shared how to identify which patients (and their family members) may be suitable for genetic testing, as well as how these tests can also help with safer prescriptions and enhanced disease management. Additionally, participants got to read pedigree charts, interpret clinical genetic reports, and practise addressing patient queries about healthcare insurance. <br><br>A huge thank you to all speakers and participants who contributed to the success of the course, including: Dr Rose Fok, A/Prof Goh Lee Gan, Dr Zhang Zewen, Ms Sowmya Jonnagadla, Ms Nur Diana Binte Ishak, and Ms Jeanette Yuen.</p><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Resources/Events/240114_fpsc_02.jpg"></div><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Resources/Events/240114_fpsc_04.jpg"></div><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Resources/Events/240114_fpsc_05.jpg"></div><p></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Resources/Events/240114_fpsc_07.jpg"></div><p></p>
