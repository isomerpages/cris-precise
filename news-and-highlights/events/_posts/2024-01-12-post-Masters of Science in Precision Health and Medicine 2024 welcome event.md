  Lin School of Medicine’s (NUSMed) Department of Biochemistry welcomed the
  inaugural batch of students who are starting on the new Master of Science in
  Precision Health and Medicine (MScPHM) programme. PRECISE is proud to have
  partnered with NUSMed to launch this MScPHM. As precision medicine moves
  towards clinical care, there is a need to build manpower capability in
  precision medicine areas, such as genomics, bioinformatics, data analysis and
  research.
