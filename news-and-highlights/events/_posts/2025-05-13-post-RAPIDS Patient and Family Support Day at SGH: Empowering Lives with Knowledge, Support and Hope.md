<p><strong>RAPIDS Patient and Family Support Day at SGH: Empowering Lives with Knowledge, Support and Hope</strong>
</p>
<p>On 19 April 2025, the “Genetic Cystic Kidney Disease: Patient and Family
Support Day” was held at Singapore General Hospital (SGH), bringing together
around 50 participants—including patients, caregivers, and members of the
public. Organised by the Renal Alliance for PrecIsion Diagnosis in Singapore
(RAPIDS), this outreach is part of the Clinical Implementation Pilot (CIP)
for primary renal diseases, supported by Precision Health Research, Singapore
(PRECISE).</p>
<p>This event exemplified how <strong>precision medicine</strong> and community
outreach can empower individuals and families living with genetic kidney
conditions. It also reflected the broader goal of the Clinical Implementation
Pilots under PRECISE—to integrate genomic medicine into clinical care pathways
in ways that are impactful, sustainable, and patient-centred.</p>

<p><strong>Overview of Event</strong>
</p>
<p>The event opened with warm remarks by <strong>A/Prof Tan Chieh Suai</strong> (HOD
and Senior Consultant, Renal Medicine, SGH), who thanked the organising
team for their dedication. <strong>A/Prof Ng Kar Hui</strong> (Senior Consultant,
Paediatrics, NUH and Clinical Co-PI of RAPIDS) introduced the audience
to cystic kidney diseases and the role of genetic testing in diagnosis
and care planning.</p>
<p>The session continued with a series of informative talks:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Dr Kwek Jia Liang</strong> (Senior Consultant, Renal Medicine,
SGH) explained <strong>autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD)</strong> and
the key genes PKD1 and PKD2. He also highlighted how genetic testing can
guide personalised care plans.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Dr Lee Tung Lin</strong> (Associate Consultant, Renal Medicine,
SGH) provided a broad overview of <strong>chronic kidney disease (CKD)</strong>,
its causes, symptoms, and the importance of lifestyle modifications to
support kidney function.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Ms Clarissa Leong</strong> (Dietitian, TTSH) made the topic of
nutrition accessible through mini-quizzes and familiar local food examples,
empowering participants to make kidney-friendly food choices.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A heartwarming highlight was an <strong>art therapy session</strong> led
by <strong>Ms Loo Hwee Hwee</strong> and the NUH Paediatrics team. Using
the "Tree of Wellbeing" activity, participants reflected on their values,
strengths, and sources of support while sharing in small group discussions.
The session closed with a gentle reminder that support is always within
reach.</p>
<p>The event concluded with an interactive <strong>Q&amp;A panel</strong> featuring
A/Prof Ng, Dr Kwek, Dr Lee, and Ms Leong. The panel addressed practical
questions on treatments, financial support, healthy hawker options, and
early detection practices.</p>
