<p>SINGAPORE, 10 OCTOBER 2025 – A new research initiative, GLOW (Gut Linked
Outcomes in Wellbeing) will be launched in Singapore to investigate how
the human gut microbiome—often described as the body’s “second genome”—influences
mental health.</p>
<p>The multi-institutional team, comprising scientists and clinicians from
Duke-NUS Medical School; the Agency for Science, Technology and Research
(A*STAR) Genome Institute of Singapore (A*STAR GIS); NHG Health’s Institute
of Mental Health (IMH), NHG Polyclinics and Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH);
Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine (LKCMedicine) at Nanyang Technological
University, Singapore; the National University of Singapore (NUS); and
Precision Health Research, Singapore (PRECISE) aims to uncover how gut
microbes may shape mood, cognition, and mental health and wellbeing.</p>
<p>Building on participants from PRECISE-SG100K – an initiative which collects
genomic and health data from consented 100,000 Singaporeans to better understand
disease risk and inform tailored healthcare strategies – the three-year
study will recruit over 6,000 participants from all races, including both
healthy individuals and those with lived experience of mental health conditions
such as depression and anxiety, to investigate how the gut microbiome influences
mental wellbeing.</p>
<p>By collecting biological samples (stool, skin, saliva, and blood) and
comprehensive psychological data across Singapore’s major ancestry groups,
researchers aim to uncover how microbial ecosystems interact with mood,
cognition, and overall mental health. The study integrates cutting-edge
multi-omics technologies, which are advanced methods that examine how multiple
biological systems interact all at once, to generate research insights
that will inform the development of more precise and locally relevant mental
health interventions. Study participants will also undergo mental health
evaluations, and complete health and lifestyle questionnaires.</p>
<p>The study participants will be enrolled through clinical partners via
referral at IMH, TTSH, and NHG Polyclinics. They will also be added as
new members of the existing PRECISE-SG100K cohort.</p>
<p>Enrolment will commence only after securing ethical approvals and establishing
comprehensive oversight procedures to safeguard participant welfare and
data privacy.</p>
<p>Gut microbes produce compounds that influence inflammation, brain signalling,
and stress responses—pathways connected to mental health. Imbalance of
such microbes has been linked to conditions like depression, anxiety, and
cognitive disorders.</p>
<p>Currently, researchers are beginning to understand that while most serotonin
is produced and used in the gut, the gut-brain axis allows for complex
communication between the digestive and nervous systems.</p>
<p>GLOW combines expertise from psychiatry, population health, genomics,
gut health (gastroenterology), and data science to move beyond simply identifying
correlations and work towards understanding causative pathways. The research
will have a focus on preventive care, and aims to inform future treatments
and interventions.</p>
<p>This study, made possible through a philanthropic gift, aims to bridge
the gap between scientific discovery and real-world applications to improve
patient health outcomes. It also represents a unique opportunity for Singapore
to lead globally in pioneering microbiome-based approaches to mental health,
particularly within diverse and urban Asian populations.</p>
<p>“This multi-institutional initiative reflects our shared goal to address
the challenge of mental health through innovative, science-driven and team-based
solutions,” said <strong>Professor Patrick Tan, Dean-designate of Duke-NUS Medical School and Executive Director of PRECISE</strong>.
“By bringing together PRECISE’s precision medicine platform with Duke-NUS’
strengths in biomedical research, we aim to uncover how the Asian gut microbiome
shapes mental health. These insights could guide not only more targeted
interventions in Singapore but also contribute to global understanding
of mental health in diverse populations.”</p>
<p>“There is growing evidence that the gut and brain are deeply connected
through complex biochemical pathways, but we lack studies grounded in local
populations,” said <strong>Professor John Chambers, Lead Principal Investigator (PI), PRECISE and PRECISE-SG100K</strong>.</p>
<p>“Our goal is to bring this science out of the lab and into the clinic
– so patients, caregivers, and doctors can benefit from precision insights
that are both biologically and culturally relevant,” added <strong>Professor Chambers, who is also Chief Scientific Officer, PRECISE and Programme Director of the Population &amp; Global Health Research Programme at LKCMedicine</strong>.</p>
<p>"Understanding why some patients respond better to certain therapies than
others is a major clinical gap," said <strong>Associate Professor Jimmy Lee, Senior Consultant and Clinician-Scientist at the Institute of Mental Health, NHG Health.</strong> "By
studying the microbiome alongside mental health conditions such as depression,
we hope to gain new insights into biological pathways that could inform
better diagnosis, prevention, and treatment. For patients, this research
holds promise that one day care for depression may not only involve the
mind, but also the body in a more holistic way—potentially opening up new
avenues for mental health research in Singapore."</p>
<p>“The human gut microbiome is a powerful, largely untapped resource,” said <strong>Associate Professor Niranjan Nagarajan, Associate Director, AI &amp; Compute at the A*STAR Genome Institute of Singapore, and Associate Professor at the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine and School of Computing at the National University of Singapore.</strong> “Emerging
research suggests that the human gut microbiome may influence brain function
through its interactions with the nervous and immune systems. In addition,
it plays a key role in regulating immunity and metabolism. We are only
beginning to uncover its potential in the context of mental health.”</p>

<h3><strong>ABOUT “GLOW”</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Gut Linked Outcomes in Wellbeing (GLOW)</strong>
</p>
<p>This study builds on the Singapore National Precision Medicine (NPM) programme’s
foundational PRECISE-SG100K cohort, which collects genomic and health data
from 100,000 Singaporeans to better understand disease risk and inform
tailored healthcare strategies. GLOW will extend and expand PRECISE-SG100K
research activities by incorporating comprehensive microbiome and mental
health data into the existing precision medicine framework.</p>
<p>Over 6,000 participants of Chinese, Malay, and Indian ancestry will be
invited to participate in the study. This includes both healthy individuals
and those with lived experience of mental health conditions such as depression.
Researchers will collect stool, skin, and blood samples, alongside detailed
health, lifestyle, and psychological assessments. Using advanced technologies—including
metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, and metabolomics—the research team will
collect stool samples from study participants to study the composition,
function, and biochemical activity of participants’ microbial communities
at high resolution.</p>
<p>The primary goal is to investigate how human microbial ecosystems—particularly
the gut microbiome—are associated with mental health outcomes such as mood,
, risk of depression, as well as cognition. By characterising host-microbiome
interactions across a multi-ancestry Asian cohort, the study aims to shed
light on how biological and environmental factors jointly contribute to
mental health.</p>
<p>This initiative aligns with the broader objectives of the National Precision
Medicine programme by advancing precision health strategies that integrate
genomic, microbial, and environmental data. The datasets and insights generated
will inform future research, including the identification of microbial
biomarkers and novel therapeutic targets. In doing so, the study will contribute
to the development of more effective, accessible, and contextually relevant
approaches to mental health care in Singapore and the region.</p>

<h3><strong>GLOSSARY</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Biomarker: </strong>A measurable biological signal (such as a
molecule, gene, or metabolite) that can indicate a normal or disease process,
or a response to treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Gut microbiome:</strong> The community of trillions of bacteria,
viruses, fungi, and other microorganisms living in the human digestive
tract. These microbes play an important role in digestion, immunity, and
overall health.</p>
<p><strong>Host-microbiome interactions</strong> The dynamic relationship
between the human body (the “host”) and the trillions of microbes living
in the gut. These interactions influence key biological processes—including
digestion, immune regulation, and chemical signaling to the brain—which
may play a role in shaping mood, stress response, and overall mental well-being.</p>
<p><strong>Metagenomics:</strong> The study of genetic material recovered
directly from microbial communities, allowing scientists to identify which
microbes are present and what genes they carry.</p>
<p><strong>Metatranscriptomics:</strong> The study of RNA molecules produced
by microbes, providing insights into which microbial genes are actively
being expressed and how microbes respond to different conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Metabolomics:</strong> The study of small molecules (metabolites)
produced by cells, microbes, or the body, which reflect ongoing biological
processes and can influence health and disease.</p>
<p><strong>Microbiome:</strong> The Second Genome The microbiome refers to
the vast community of microorganisms—bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other
microbes—that inhabit the human body, especially the gut. These microbes
collectively contribute over 2 million genes, vastly outnumbering the approximately
20,000 genes in the human genome. This immense genetic reservoir is often
called the "second genome" because it plays a crucial role in shaping human
health, development, and disease—complementing and interacting with our
own DNA in profound ways.</p>
<p><strong>Microbial markers:</strong> Specific types or patterns of gut bacteria
that can give clues about a person’s health—like signals that may be linked
to mood, stress, or mental wellbeing.</p>
<p><strong>Multi-omics technologies:</strong> Advanced methods that examine
multiple biological systems—such as genes (genomics), proteins (proteomics),
and gut microbes (microbiomics)—all at once, to better understand how they
interact and influence mental and physical health.</p>
<p><strong>Phenotyping: </strong>Characterising observable traits (e.g.,
clinical symptoms, molecular profiles) to better understand health and
disease.</p>
<p><strong>Study cohort:</strong> A group of people with shared characteristics
who are enrolled in a research study and followed over time to understand
health outcomes and contributing factors. E.g. GLOW targets to have a study
cohort of 6,000 participants.</p>
