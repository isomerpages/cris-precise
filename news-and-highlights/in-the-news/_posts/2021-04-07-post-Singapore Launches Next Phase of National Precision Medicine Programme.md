<h4><em>New national body established to further research insights, improve patient outcomes and create new economic opportunities for the biomedical technology industry</em></h4>
<hr>
<p>SINGAPORE, 7 April 2021 – Precision medicine is part of Singapore’s Research,
Innovation and Enterprise (RIE) 2025 strategic goal to transform and protect
the health of every Singaporean. Identified as a priority by the Ministry
of Health, precision medicine aims to understand how genomic, phenotypic,
lifestyle and clinical factors contribute to the health of Singaporeans.
It also supports the responsible use of health data in clinical applications
with the longer-term goal of addressing Singapore’s healthcare challenges
in a sustainable and clinically cost-effective manner.</p>
<p>Singapore’s National Precision Medicine (NPM) strategy is a 10-year plan
to enhance and accelerate Singapore’s biomedical research, health outcomes
and economic growth. NPM is a whole-of-government effort to establish the
necessary frameworks and infrastructure to realise precision medicine on
a national scale, to ultimately improve public health, enhance disease
prevention and to identify the right treatments for the right individuals
and groups.</p>
<p>Phase II of Singapore’s NPM strategy will start in April 2021 with a four-year
horizon and it aims to:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Further research insights into the Asian phenotype by analysing the genetic
makeup of 100,000 healthy Singaporeans and up to 50,000 patients with specific
diseases;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improve patient outcomes by piloting the implementation of precision medicine
in clinical practice; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create new economic opportunities for Singapore’s healthcare and biomedical
technology industry by attracting and anchoring overseas companies while
yielding new opportunities for home-grown enterprises.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To achieve this,&nbsp;<strong>Precision Health Research, Singapore (PRECISE),</strong>&nbsp;has
been set up as the central entity to drive NPM.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>Furthering research insights into Asian Genomes</strong></h3>
<p>Precision medicine is a fast-growing medical approach, which takes into
account a patient’s individual variables including genetics, lifestyle
as well as other environmental factors. A more comprehensive understanding
of disease-causing factors provides earlier, faster and more accurate diagnoses,
optimises treatments by prescribing the right drug at the right time, informs
the development of new drugs and therapies, and enhances disease prevention.</p>
<p>Governments around the world – including the US, UK, Denmark, Finland
and Japan – have initiated national genomics programmes to harness the
benefits of precision medicine. However, most current programmes have largely
focused on Caucasian populations or lack genetic diversity. Many conditions,
such as cancer and heart disease which can have different presentations
among Asians, remain underrepresented.</p>
<p>With its multi-ethnic population which captures 80 per cent of Asia’s
genetic diversity, Singapore is well-placed to address knowledge gaps in
Asian-specific precision medicine and complement global efforts.</p>
<p>The NPM Strategy was launched in 2017, supported under Singapore’s RIE
2020 plan. NPM Phase I culminated in the world’s largest genetic databank
for multi-ethnic Asian populations. Completed in October 2019, the NPM
Phase I databank comprises the complete genetic data of 10,000 healthy
Singaporeans, serving as a reference for Asian genetic normality and underpinning
the subsequent development of precision medicine for Singaporeans and patients
across Asia.</p>
<p>In NPM Phase II, PRECISE will collaborate with research and clinical partners
from the Singapore ecosystem, including the Agency for Science, Technology
and Research (A*STAR), Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, National Healthcare
Group, National University Health System, National University of Singapore,
and SingHealth Duke-NUS Academic Medical Centre to study the genetic makeup
of 100,000 healthy Singaporeans and up to 50,000 people with specific diseases.
The genetic data will be integrated with detailed lifestyle, environmental,
and clinical data to yield rich insights into factors that contribute to
Asian diseases and conditions.</p>
<p>“A study with this degree of genetic diversity of the population, coupled
with this level of phenotyping, is unparalleled. This a powerful approach
for identifying factors that determine why some Singaporeans, but not others,
develop certain diseases. With insights into these disease-causing factors,
researchers and doctors can develop new approaches that will not only benefit
patients in the short term but for decades to come. Additionally, as this
will require big data analysis to generate insights, we have also stepped
up efforts to ensure a secure and trustworthy data environment by actively
working with various government agencies to build a robust infrastructure
with safeguards in place to preserve data security and privacy,” said Professor
John Chambers, Chief Scientific Officer of PRECISE and one of the principal
investigators supervising and coordinating the SG100K population cohort
study. SG100K seeks to recruit 100,000 healthy participants to further
research insights into the Asian genome and how it impacts health and disease.
Prof Chambers is also the Professor of Cardiovascular Epidemiology and
the President’s Chair in Cardiovascular Epidemiology at the Lee Kong Chian
School of Medicine in Nanyang Technological University.</p>
<h3><strong>Piloting the use of precision medicine in clinical practice</strong></h3>
<p>Singapore’s rapidly ageing population and increased prevalence of chronic
diseases have changed healthcare demands fundamentally. To ensure that
healthcare delivery evolves to address these demands and remain future-ready,
precision medicine remains a key focus of the Human Health and Potential
Domain under the RIE2025 plan.</p>
<p>Precision medicine has already seen success in the treatment of rare genetic
diseases in Singapore. For over two decades, the Genetics Service at KK
Women’s and Children’s Hospital (KKH) has been providing clinical care
to paediatric patients with genetic disorders, tapping on a precision medicine
approach to disease treatments. Through&nbsp;BRIDGES (<strong>B</strong>ringing&nbsp;<strong>R</strong>esearch&nbsp;<strong>I</strong>nnovations
for the&nbsp;<strong>D</strong>iagnosis of&nbsp;<strong>GE</strong>netic
diseases in&nbsp;<strong>S</strong>ingapore), 412 families were analysed
over the last six years by genomic researchers at SingHealth, A*STAR and
Duke-NUS.&nbsp; As a result, 160 children with rare and undiagnosed conditions
were able to receive proper diagnoses that led to tailored clinical management
and improved health outcomes in at least one of three families. At 39 per
cent, BRIDGES has demonstrated a diagnostic yield that is on par with 25
to 40 per cent in similar research programmes worldwide. Precision medicine
has helped to improve understanding of the causes to genetic disorders,
and helped clinicians to assess and identify evidence-based, therapeutic
targets for developing&nbsp;precise&nbsp;treatments to the conditions.</p>
<p>“While the field of precision medicine has seen considerable progress
in recent years, there remains an urgent need for research findings to
be translated into standard clinical practice. In NPM Phase II, we will
be working with doctors, healthcare institutions and the Ministry of Health
to find ways to apply precision medicine to improve the health of Singaporeans
in a way that is affordable and maximises the benefit to the patient,”
said Professor Tai E Shyong, Chief Medical Officer at PRECISE. He is also
a Senior Consultant in the Division of Endocrinology at the National University
Hospital and Professor at the National University of Singapore’s Yong Loo
Lin School of Medicine, Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health and Duke-NUS
Medical School.</p>
<h3>Creating new economic opportunities for Singapore’s healthcare and biomedical technology industry</h3>
<p>Making precision medicine a reality in Singapore requires a long-term
and concerted commitment from both the Government and the industry. In
addition to expanding research efforts and establishing national clinical
workflows, NPM Phase II will continue to partner the National Research
Foundation Singapore (NRF), A*STAR, the Economic Development Board, and
the Health Promotion Board to catalyse the next phase of growth for Singapore’s
healthcare and biomedical technology industry by attracting and anchoring
overseas companies in Singapore, and creating new opportunities for home-grown
enterprises.</p>
<p>Executive Director of PRECISE Professor Patrick Tan said: “Pharmaceutical,
biotechnology, and data science companies are a key component of Singapore’s
NPM strategy. They bring our research from bench to bedside by developing
and manufacturing new drugs and therapies for patients. PRECISE will be
looking to develop meaningful public-private partnership models to facilitate
growth and drive innovation across the healthcare and biotechnology industry
– creating higher-value jobs, nurturing the next generation of scientists
and clinicians and strengthening Singapore’s status as the region’s leading
medical hub to deliver precision medicine based treatments.” Professor
Tan is also the Executive Director of the Genome Institute of Singapore
at A*STAR and Professor at Duke-NUS Medical School.</p>
