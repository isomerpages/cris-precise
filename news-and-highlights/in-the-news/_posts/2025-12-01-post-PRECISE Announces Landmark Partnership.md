<hr>
<p><strong>SINGAPORE, 1 DECEMBER 2025&nbsp;</strong>–&nbsp;Precision Health
Research, Singapore (PRECISE) is pleased to announce a landmark partnership
with companies Alnylam, Bayer, Boehringer Ingelheim and Novo Nordisk, under
Phase II of Singapore’s National Precision Medicine (NPM) programme.</p>
<p>This pioneering initiative marks Singapore as the first country in Asia
to establish a pre-competitive collaboration with leading pharmaceutical
companies,<em> </em>contributing to a vibrant precision health ecosystem
and reaffirming Singapore as a leading hub for precision medicine innovation
in Asia.<sup>[1]</sup>
</p>
<p>By leveraging Singapore’s unique multi-ancestry Asian population, the
collaboration will advance insights into Asian genetics and beyond to tailor
new precision medicines worldwide based on the specific insights from this
population. This will be done by enhancing existing datasets from the PRECISE-SG100K
study, Southeast Asia’s most comprehensive population health study comprising
rich phenotypic characterisation and whole genome sequencing data of 100,000
consented participants, while ensuring strong data governance and security.</p>
<p>The collaboration will address diversity gaps in global genomic research,
generate new, high-quality research to improve understanding of health,
risk factors and medical conditions, as well as support the development
of novel diagnostics and treatments optimised for Asian populations. This
collaboration will accelerate advancements in biomedical research and healthcare
innovation in the field of precision medicine. In the longer term, it is
anticipated that the collaboration will help to drive better health outcomes
for Singaporeans, with the potential for regional and global applications
to benefit Asians worldwide.</p>
<p>This partnership could also bring significant economic benefits to Singapore.
Collaboration partners Alnylam, Bayer, Boehringer Ingelheim and Novo Nordisk
will contribute investments to support research activities and create employment
opportunities in Singapore, as well as facilitate knowledge transfer, and
strengthen Singapore’s biomedical research data infrastructure.</p>
<p>This initiative will provide research insights from Asians to complement
existing public-private genomic programmes in Europeans such as the UK
Biobank and FinnGen to address the gaps in global genomic research, increasing
diversity and greater equity for healthcare solutions and innovations.</p>
<p><strong>Key Highlights of the Collaboration</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Delivering benefits for Singapore and Asia: </strong>By advancing
precision medicine, the collaboration aims to develop better diagnostics
and treatments tailored to Singapore’s multi-ethnic population. These efforts
contribute to improved disease diagnosis and prevention, enabling more
targeted and effective treatments, and the integration of precision medicine
into healthcare applications. This partnership will contribute to greater
diversity in research and equity in the form of healthcare innovations
tailored to Asian populations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Singapore as a hub for precision medicine and innovation in Asia</strong>:
The collaboration enhances Singapore’s position as a hub for biomedical
research and innovation, setting new benchmarks for excellence in the region.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Enhancing datasets to drive research and innovation: </strong>The
PRECISE-SG100K dataset is one of the largest and one of the most comprehensive
non-European population datasets and will bridge the gap between human
genome and diseases for the Asian population, providing insights into health
and the impact of lifestyle and environment on disease development. The
collaboration will augment and further enrich the PRECISE-SG100K dataset,
creating a robust and valuable resource for ongoing and future research.
The enhanced datasets will accelerate the development of innovative diagnostics,
therapeutics and enrich resources available to researchers and healthcare
providers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Enhancing the local economy and data science capabilities</strong>:
Singapore's commitment to enrich a thriving biomedical ecosystem is further
strengthened by this partnership. The initiative will support job creation
through roles such as bioinformaticians, data scientists, software engineers
and project managers. It will also enhance data science capabilities, foster
research collaboration by generating large scale analyses for data insights
and future research, as well as create essential infrastructure and develop
secure data platforms. These developments will facilitate knowledge transfer,
bolstering Singapore’s leadership capabilities in research and innovation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Prof. Patrick Tan, Executive Director of PRECISE, said, "This groundbreaking
partnership represents a significant milestone for PRECISE. By collaborating
with Alnylam, Bayer, Boehringer Ingelheim and Novo Nordisk, we are harnessing
the collective expertise of our partners to propel biomedical research
and innovation as part of Singapore’s NPM programme.&nbsp; As a small but
dynamic country, Singapore’s strong reputation for trust, integrity and
reliability, as well as our adaptability to seize opportunities, makes
us a preferred choice for collaboration. By leveraging our diverse population
and unique competitive advantages, we are well positioned to widen collaboration
with a range of partners, driving innovation and setting benchmarks for
excellence at the forefront of the precision medicine landscape in Asia.”</p>
<p>Prof. John Chambers, Chief Scientific Officer, PRECISE, shared, “This
partnership is built on a foundation of robust safeguards and governance
frameworks. There is Institutional Review Board approval and opt-in informed
consent from PRECISE-SG100K study participants for industry to use their
donated anonymised data for research by both academic and industry researchers,
who will be granted controlled access in compliance with Singapore’s regulations.
Additionally, the researchers will not be downloading any datasets. PRECISE
also works closely with the <a href="https://trustplatform.sg/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">TRUST platform</a>,
a tool that enables health data analytics and innovation, to ensure strong
data governance and security, and to safeguard participant privacy and
maintain public trust.”</p>
<p>With the support of ecosystem partners and stakeholders, the collaboration
injects fresh ideas and capabilities into the precision medicine landscape,
transforming healthcare and improving patient outcomes, to benefit not
only the multi-ethnic population in Singapore but also the wider Asian
population and global communities. This public-private partnership exemplifies
the power of collaboration between academia, industry, and healthcare providers,
combining complementary expertise to drive healthcare innovation, biomedical
excellence and enhancing the local economy for Singapore.</p>
