<p><strong>SINGAPORE, 20 February 2023</strong>&nbsp;– Precision Health Research,
Singapore (PRECISE) today announced two multi-institutional studies of
nearly 10,000 Singaporeans1 identifying genetic variations in ethnic Chinese,
Malay and Indian individuals predisposing them to highly prevalent conditions
with high disease burden and adverse responses to widely used drugs. The
studies are among the first of their kind in Asian populations.</p>
<p>The studies, published in the leading scientific journals Nature Genetics
and Nature Communications, were led by researchers from the Agency for
Science Technology and Research (A*STAR), Duke-NUS Medical School, SingHealth
Duke-NUS Institute of Precision Medicine (PRISM), KK Women’s and Children’s
Hospital, National Cancer Center Singapore, Nanyang Technological University
Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore
Eye Research Institute, Tan Tock Seng Hospital, PRECISE and other participating
institutions2, and are part of Singapore’s National Precision Medicine
(NPM) programme funded by the National Research Foundation and participating
institutions. The NPM programme is a national-scale initiative that seeks
to harness precision medicine and genomic analyses to improve the health
of Singaporeans.</p>
<p>In the Nature Genetics study, a genomic reference database of 10,000 Singaporeans
was mapped by researchers from A*STAR’s Genome Institute of Singapore (GIS),
revealing millions of genetic variants previously undetected in studies
from Western populations. The resulting database represents a unique resource
for the Singapore biomedical community and was funded under the Industry
Alignment Fund (IAF) programme. The study also outlined how the NPM programme
will improve understanding of diseases impacting Asians and the development
of novel strategies to manage and treat them.</p>
<p><strong>Genetic variations influencing disease risk and response to medication</strong>
</p>
<p>Leveraging this database, the Nature Communications study then investigated
the genomes of Singaporean Chinese, Malay and Indian individuals to gain
deeper insights into their predisposition for known genetic disorders.
They found a high prevalence of familial hypercholesterolemia3 and hereditary
breast and ovarian cancer-associated variants4 at 1 in 140 and 1 in 150
respectively. These findings that familial hypercholesterolemia is high
in Chinese compared to other groups in Singapore are consistent with that
of other studies which have reported higher burden of Low-Density Lipoprotein
Receptor (LDLR) mutations in East Asians versus those of European ancestries.
Other findings (e.g. burden of actionable pharmacogenomics mutations) are
broadly in-line with that of other populations. Ethnic differences in prevalence
were observed. These are the first conclusive findings highlighting a significant
burden of genetic disease predisposition in Singapore and reinforce current
understanding of the role of genetic variants in determining an individual’s
disease risk.</p>
<p>“The considerable size of the SG10K_Health cohort provides an exciting
opportunity to better understand the types of genetic diseases that Singaporeans
are at risk for. This will help clinicians know which genetic diseases
to look out for in their patients, and to design better genetic tests,”
said the study’s lead principal investigator, Assistant Professor Lim Weng
Khong, from the Cancer &amp; Stem Cell Biology Programme at Duke-NUS Medical
School, and PRISM.</p>
<p>Besides disease predisposition, the researchers also identified genetic
variations that can predict adverse drug reactions to widely used drugs
such as statins, anti-epileptic medications, chemotherapy, and supportive
medications. The study reported that more than 1 in 4 Singaporeans (26.8%)
carries a genetic variant that increases the risk of life-threatening side
effects of at least one medication; knowing if an individual carries a
relevant genetic variant when these specific drugs are prescribed can help
to reduce side effects. This finding is highly relevant as recognition
of the importance of pharmacogenomics 5 in providing safe and effective
healthcare grows.</p>
<p><strong>Potential to improve patient outcomes through genetic profiling</strong>
</p>
<p>The studies are of clinical importance as the lack of representation of
South East Asians in current genomic databases can increase the risk of
misdiagnosis or mistreatment by healthcare professionals less familiar
with managing genetic disorders and associated symptoms found in non-European
populations. This bias may lead to challenges in clinical interpretation
of rare variants in non-Europeans, reducing the likelihood of reporting
and perpetuating the lack of publicly available information. The studies
will thus help to develop tailor-made screening panels for the Asian population.</p>
<p>“By gaining a deeper understanding of genetic diseases that are prevalent
in our population – individuals and couples, particularly those planning
to start a family, can make more informed health-related decisions. For
instance, they can opt for screening to identify any potential risks of
passing severe genetic diseases to their offspring and take proactive measures
to mitigate those risks before starting a family,” said Dr Saumya Shekhar
Jamuar, Senior Consultant, Genetics Service, KK Women’s and Children’s
Hospital, principal investigator.</p>
<p>“Beyond shedding light on genomic diversity in Asians, this confirmation
that genetic variants greatly affect Singaporeans’ risk for prevalent diseases,
supports the need to review currently available genetic services across
restructured hospitals in Singapore,” said Professor Tai E Shyong, Chief
Medical Officer, PRECISE. He is also a Senior Consultant in the Division
of Endocrinology at the National University Hospital and Professor at the
National University of Singapore’s Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, Saw
Swee Hock School of Public Health and Duke-NUS Medical School.</p>
<p>“Singapore’s current cancer screening guidelines are age-based. Our data
suggests that given the high prevalence of hereditary breast and ovarian
cancer and Lynch syndrome locally, a gene-directed risk stratified approach
for breast and colon cancer screening should be adopted,” said principal
investigator Associate Professor Joanne Ngeow, Head, Cancer Genetics Service,
National Cancer Centre Singapore and Associate Professor at Nanyang Technological
University’s Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Efforts to incorporate genetic and genomic testing into clinical pathways
are already underway. Based on these findings, PRECISE’s Clinical Implementation
Pilots for familial hypercholesterolemia, breast cancer, pharmacogenomics,
hereditary and familial cancers and primary glomerular diseases, are now
being conducted at several public healthcare institutions across Singapore.
The findings of these pilots will inform the feasibility of a value-based
healthcare ecosystem and cost-effectiveness of incorporating genetic screening
into clinical workflows for earlier diagnosis and optimal management of
disease.</p>
<p>“Although Asians comprise 60 per cent of the global population, Asian
genomes and particularly South East Asia are underrepresented in current
genomic studies. Our multi- institutional studies are thus significant
in highlighting the genomic diversity of South East Asians, offering opportunities
for new discoveries and better prevention and treatment strategies for
Singaporeans” said Professor Patrick Tan, Executive Director, PRECISE and
A*STAR’s (GIS). He is also a faculty member of Duke-NUS Medical School.</p>
