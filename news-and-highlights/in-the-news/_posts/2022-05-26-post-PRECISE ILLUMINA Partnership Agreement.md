**Singapore launches Southeast Asia’s most comprehensive consented population study with 100,000 whole genomes for health and clinical breakthroughs**
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

_Unique large-scale population study will yield insights into Asian-specific diseases, improving population health, patient outcomes, and innovations in the local biomedical technology industry._

SINGAPORE, 26 May 2022 – Precision Health Research, Singapore (PRECISE), the central entity implementing Singapore’s National Precision Medicine (NPM) strategy, and Illumina, Inc (Illumina), a leader in genomics technology, announced today a strategic partnership to sequence and analyse **100,000 Singaporean whole genomes (SG100K), to create for the first time, Southeast Asia’s most comprehensive consented population study.**

2\. Precision Medicine has been identified by Singapore’s Ministry of Health as one of the potential innovative approaches to transform healthcare and address healthcare challenges, and also by the National Research Foundation, Singapore (NRF) as a strategic goal of the Research, Innovation and Enterprise (RIE) 2025 plan to transform and protect the health of Singaporeans. PRECISE, funded by NRF, collaborates with Singapore research and clinical partners to implement and coordinate this effort nationally.

3\. The SG100K project, supported under Open Fund – Large Collaborative Grant1, will involve 100,000 consented Singaporean participants, comprising Chinese, Malay and Indian, representative of 80% of the populations across Asia. **SG100K involves multiple research and clinical partners such as medical schools and healthcare clusters to monitor the long-term health outcomes of Singaporeans. It is considered as the region’s leading precision medicine database, yielding deep insights into Asian genomic diversity and Asian-specific diseases. This allows Singapore to better understand key social, environmental, lifestyle and genetic factors associated with important diseases relevant to multi-ethnic Singapore such as diabetes, hypertension, cancer and others.** SG100K will also enable data-driven approaches to be adopted for improving population health and patient outcomes, revealing why some Singaporeans, but not others, develop certain diseases.

**Leveraging the Latest in Technology**

4\. The three-year PRECISE-Illumina (PRECISE-ILMN) partnership will boost Singapore’s NPM strategy with high-quality genomic data generated at accelerated speed. Leveraging Illumina’s experience and capabilities in large-scale genomic sequencing, the data would be generated based on international best practices and standards. The partnership will also see PRECISE and Illumina collaborating on enterprise-grade data exchange platforms for the secure handling and sharing of anonymised biospecimen data for sequencing, and the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches for genomics analysis. Local sequencing companies in Singapore will also benefit from this collaboration, through training and certification in the usage of Illumina’s proprietary platforms; allowing them to access new markets in the region and internationally.
