<p>Our programme, <a href="https://www.npm.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Precision Health Research, Singapore</a> (PRECISE),
is supporting <a href="https://www.npm.sg/cip/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">clinical implementation pilots</a> which
facilitate the incorporation of genetic/genomic tests into clinical pathways
to improve patient outcomes.</p>
<p>One such pilot is the Pre-emptive Pharmacogenomic Testing (PPGx) clinical
implementation pilot which aims to investigate the impact of <strong>incorporating pre-emptive multi-drug/multi-gene PPGx testing as a precision medicine clinical tool in routine clinical practice,</strong> for
appropriate prescribing to maximise the benefits of treatment while minimising
side effects.</p>
