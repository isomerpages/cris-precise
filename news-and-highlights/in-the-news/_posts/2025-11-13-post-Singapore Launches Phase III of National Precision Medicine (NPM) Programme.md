<p><strong>SINGAPORE, 14 NOVEMBER 2025</strong> – The Precision Health Research,
Singapore (PRECISE) marked the launch of Phase III of the National Precision
Medicine (NPM) programme, with the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding
(MOU) between PRECISE and senior representatives from NHG Health, National
University Health System (NUHS) and SingHealth.</p>
<p>The MOU reflects the shared commitment of PRECISE and Singapore’s three
public healthcare clusters to work together and enrol about 10% of Singapore's
local resident population as study participants over the next five years.</p>
<p>NPM Phase III will be conducted as a large-scale research initiative to
generate robust, population-specific evidence as to the cost and effectiveness
of using genomic information in healthcare when scaled beyond pilots to
population levels. These insights will help guide how genomic information
could, in future, be responsibly integrated into healthcare to support
physicians and patients in preventive and more targeted care.</p>
<p><strong>NPM Phase III: From Research Insights to Real-World Impact</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>“We are pleased to work with our colleagues from the healthcare clusters to launch Phase III and research partners in A*STAR and the ecosystem,” said Professor Patrick Tan, Executive Director of PRECISE</strong>.
“In Phase II, we studied healthy cohorts to contribute to population health
research. In Phase III, we will work with individuals receiving medical
treatments and clinical services, including those with specific disease
conditions. This will allow important studies to better understand how
genomic information may be used to support improved health outcomes. Importantly,
Phase III is about understanding and addressing the practical challenges
of integrating precision medicine into clinical care in a thoughtful, sustainable,
and equitable way.”</p>
<p><strong>"DNA (genetic) testing is already making a difference in selected clinical settings—helping doctors detect conditions earlier, explore targeted therapies, and refine care approaches," said Professor Tai E Shyong, Chief Medical Officer at PRECISE</strong>.
"Over time, as more gene-disease pairs are identified, greater awareness
of how genes and genomic background can predispose some individuals to
inherited conditions could encourage more preventive and timely healthcare,
helping individuals make informed choices earlier. Insights from one patient's
data could, in turn, guide better care for the next."</p>
<p><strong>Building on Strong Foundations</strong>
</p>
<p>Precision medicine is a key strategic priority under Singapore's Research,
Innovation and Enterprise (RIE) 2025 plan, and is recognised by the Ministry
of Health as a key enabler of future-ready healthcare. <strong>Professor John Chambers, Chief Scientific Officer at PRECISE, said, “Singapore is uniquely positioned to lead precision medicine in Asia. Our multi-ancestry population, strong public healthcare and research infrastructure, and ability to integrate health and research data make it possible to generate insights that are clinically relevant for Chinese, Malay, Indian and other Asian communities.”</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>“We are working to apply recent biomedical advances to expand the role of genomics in healthcare,” said Clinical Associate Professor Tan Ee Shien, Chief Innovation Officer at PRECISE. </strong>“Together
with our hospital partners and MOH, we are working systematically to assess
clinical utility, population health impact, system readiness, and patient
perspectives of more disease areas so as to guide these innovations through
the appropriate pathways for clinical adoption.”</p>
<p><strong>Contributing to Research that Can Shape the Future of Healthcare</strong>
</p>
<p>To date, the NPM programme has sequenced over 100,000 Singapore citizens
and Permanent Residents, driven innovations in screening and diagnosis,
and positioned Singapore as a regional leader in genomics research and
implementation. As Phase III begins, members of the public receiving care
in public healthcare institutions may be invited to participate.</p>
<p>By contributing to this study, patient participants can help <strong>advance research that may shape future healthcare </strong>for
families and communities. Participation is voluntary, and all data collected
will be securely stored and handled.</p>
