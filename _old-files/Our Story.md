Phase II aims to transform healthcare in Singapore and improve patient
outcomes through new insights into the Asian genome and data-driven healthcare
solutions. The NPM programme also enhance the breadth and depth of the
Precision Medicine-related industries by attracting and anchoring overseas
companies in Singapore while yielding new opportunities for home-grown
companies.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Making precision medicine in Singapore possible requires long-term commitments
from both the government and private industries. This strategy will be
implemented as three phases.</p>
<p>Phase I of Singapore’s National Precision Medicine (NPM) programme set
the stage by establishing a Singaporean reference database containing 10,000
genomes, and partnering with industry as co-investors in the NPM programme.</p>
<p>Phase II was launched in 2021 and aims to generate the genomes of 100,000
healthy Singaporeans and 50,000 people with specific diseases. Phase II
will pilot clinical implementation of precision medicine approaches and
establish data infrastructure for the linkage of genomic data with electronic
health records and other data types. Precision Health Research, Singapore
(PRECISE) is the central entity incorporated to coordinate Phase II.</p>
<p>Phase III will implement precision medicine in Singapore on a large scale
and is expected to span from 2025 to 2030. Besides genomic sequencing of
approximately 10% of Singapore's population, the genomic data will be linked
with clinical and lifestyle data to create large Singaporean databases.
Ultimately, doctors and scientists can use these valuable resources to
reach a deeper understanding of how diseases develop, and discover better
ways to prevent and treat them.</p>
