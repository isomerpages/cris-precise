<h1><strong>What is Precision Medicine and Why it Matters</strong></h1>
<h3><strong>What is DNA?</strong></h3>
<p>DNA is the instruction book of life. Six billion ‘letters’ long, this
book is largely the same between individuals as all humans share 99.9%
of their DNA. But the 0.1% difference is what makes each of us unique,
and can sometimes even make the difference between health and disease.</p>

<h3><strong>Medicine as it is Practised Today</strong></h3>
<p>Although doctors know that your DNA can influence how you respond to treatments,
they don’t routinely sequence your entire DNA book to predict your treatment
outcome.</p>
<p>In fact, only 10% of health outcomes are determined by healthcare. One
third is determined by genetics, while the rest is affected by social or
environmental factors and behavioural patterns which are poorly captured
during routine medical consultations.</p>

</div>
<p>With this "one-size-fits-all" approach, all patients are given the same
treatment even though
<br>not all experience benefits and some even face negative side effects.</p>

<h4>What is Precision Medicine?</h4>
<p>Instead of treating all patients the same way, precision medicine takes
individual variations in genetics, environmental and lifestyle factors
into account, allowing doctors to more accurately predict which treatment
and prevention strategies will work in different groups of people. Enabled
by tools to analyse data on a large scale and with DNA sequencing becoming
more affordable, precision medicine can improve healthcare by giving doctors
a more detailed understanding of each patient.</p>

<h3><strong>PRECISION MEDICINE EFFORTS AROUND THE WORLD</strong></h3>
<p>To help harness the benefits of precision medicine for their people, governments
around the world have initiated national genomics programmes.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/About%20Us/Why%20We%20Do%20It/map-1161px%20(1).jpg">
</div>
<p>Most of these national programmes, however, are focused on Western or
European populations. Asian people—who make up 60% of the world population—are
under-represented in these databases.</p>
<h3><strong>SINGAPORE’S CONTRIBUTION TO PRECISION MEDICINE</strong></h3>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width:150px" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/About%20Us/Why%20We%20Do%20It/precise-logo.png">
</div>
<p>With its multi-ethnic population that captures the diversity of Asia's
genomes and strong research capabilities, Singapore is in an ideal position
to address our lack of understanding of Asian-specific genetic conditions.
Precision Health Research, Singapore (PRECISE) is the central entity coordinating
a whole of government effort to implement phase II of Singapore's 10-year
National Precision Medicine strategy.</p>

<h3><strong>HOW WILL MY DATA BE USED?</strong></h3>
<p>To realise the potential of precision medicine, genetic data needs to
be linked to lifestyle and health information. Scientists can then use
this data to find out the significance of each genetic variant and how
different treatments or behaviours can change clinical outcomes.</p>
<p>However, there are hundreds of thousands of genetic variants which can
each occur in different populations at different levels. To identify the
relevant variants, large databases are required. In other words, the more
people that participate, the more accurate the predictions can be.</p>

<h3><strong>Public Engagement Efforts</strong></h3>
<p>Our work will not succeed without a Here are some activities we have conducted
over the years to get your input on what precision medicine can do for
Singapore and how we should go about doing it:</p>

<p>Your valuable feedback has shaped the way PRECISE is run, including how
the data collected is stored, secured and retrieved.</p>

<h3><strong>MAKING THE FUTURE OF MEDICINE A REALITY</strong></h3>
<p>Healthcare has made great strides in the last hundred years. But the next
hundred years promise to be even more exciting. Precision medicine will
not only improve the lives of patients but will also have a profound impact
on the way research is conducted and shape our future economy.</p>
