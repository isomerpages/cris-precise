<h4><strong>Patient Story: Finding the Right Medication Through Pharmacogenomics</strong></h4>
<p><strong><em>“Genetic testing ensures you receive the most effective medication without unnecessary delays — especially when it is needed the most.”</em></strong>
</p>
<p>After a heart attack, <em>Mr Tan (not his real name)</em> was prescribed
medication but soon experienced troubling breathlessness. At first, it
was not clear whether the symptoms were due to the heart condition or the
treatment itself.</p>
<p>That was when pharmacogenomics (PGx) testing provided the answer.</p>

<p>The transition was not just about switching medication — it was about
clarity and confidence. While the genetic report itself was technical,
pharmacists took the time to explain what the results meant in everyday
terms.</p>
<p>For the patient, it was eye-opening:</p>
<p>“Genetic testing equips doctors with more precise information to make
better treatment decisions.”</p>
<p>Today, this experience has changed the way the patient views healthcare.
Instead of trial-and-error, genetic testing now ensures the right drug,
first time.</p>
<p>And his message to others?</p>
<p>“Concerns about genetic privacy are personal. But if you are not overly
worried, testing is worth it. The benefits far outweigh the risks — for
you and your loved ones.”</p>
