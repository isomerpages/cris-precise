# What is Precision Medicine and Why it Matters


### What is DNA?

DNA is the instruction book of life. Six billion ‘letters’ long, this book is largely the same between individuals as all humans share 99.9% of their DNA. But the 0.1% difference is what makes each of us unique, and can sometimes even make the difference between health and disease.

### Medicine as it is Practiced Today

Although doctors know that your DNA can influence how you respond to treatments, they don’t routinely sequence your entire DNA book to predict your treatment outcome.

In fact, only 10% of health outcomes are determined by healthcare. One third is determined by genetics, while the rest is affected by social or environmental factors and behavioural patterns which are poorly captured during routine medical consultations.

With this "one-size-fits-all" approach, all patients are given the same treatment even though  
not all experience benefits and some even face negative side effects.

Instead of treating all patients the same way, precision medicine takes individual variations in genetics, environmental and lifestyle factors into account, allowing doctors to more accurately predict which treatment and prevention strategies will work in different groups of people. Enabled by tools to analyse data on a large scale and with DNA sequencing becoming more affordable, precision medicine can improve healthcare by giving doctors a more detailed understanding of each patient.

### PRECISION MEDICINE EFFORTS AROUND THE WORLD

To help harness the benefits of precision medicine for their people, governments around the  
world have initiated national genomics programmes.

Most of these national programmes, however, are focused on Western or European populations. Asian people—who make up 60% of the world population—are under-represented in these databases.
