Erasmus School of Health Policy &amp; Management (ESHPM) of Erasmus University Rotterdam is leading in the Netherlands with its educational and research activities targeted at policy and management issues in health care. ESHPM is involved in national and international research in the fields of policy and organisational sciences with a focus on health care, health economics, medical technology assessment, social medical sciences, health law and health insurance.
<br><br>
ESHPM offers a bachelor programme, four master programmes and post-academic education. Cooperatively, they also offer several post-academic educational programmes and courses for graduated master students. At ESHPM, research and educational activities are closely intertwined. Knowledge and experiences of various scientific disciplines such as economics, law, social-medical sciences, organisational science and public administration are brought together and applied to the health care sector.
<br><br>
This multidisciplinary approach to education and research is unique. Internationalisation is highly valued at ESHPM. The number of students, teachers and researchers from abroad has risen significantly over the past years and has enriched its study programmes.
