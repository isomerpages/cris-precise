The Health Intervention and Technology Assessment Program (HITAP) is a semi-autonomous research institute in the Ministry of Public Health (MoPH), Thailand. HITAP is renowned for its expertise in health technology assessment (HTA) that generates evidence to define the benefits package for Thailand’s&nbsp;Universal Coverage Scheme (UCS) and the National List of Essential Medicines (NLEM). In addition, HITAP has a diverse set of skills in the sphere of health systems research and collaborates with partners globally to promote the use of evidence in healthcare decision-making. It has conducted economic evaluations of health technologies such as vaccines, drugs and devices. As part of its international work, HITAP has supported the development of HTA in India, Indonesia, Vietnam, the Philippines, Bhutan and Kenya, among others. Building on its technical expertise in HTA, HITAP has conducted program evaluations and health service research commissioned by domestic and international agencies in Thailand, Myanmar, Timor Leste&nbsp;and the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK). HITAP has also developed resources for HTA researchers, particularly in low-and-middle income countries, such as the Guide to Health Economic Analysis and Research (GEAR) and knowledge products such as an evidence&nbsp;package on “Non–communicable Disease Prevention: Best Buys, Wasted Buys, and Contestable Buys”.

HITAP is a member of the International Decision Support Initiative (iDSI), a global network of priority setting institutions. It works closely with its regional partners in the region through the Strengthening Active Partnerships for Policy and Health Intervention Research and Evaluation (SAPPHIRE), which includes the National Health Foundation (NHF), the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore (NUS), the Mahidol Oxford Tropical Research Unit (MORU) and Hitotsubashi University. In recognition of its efforts, in 2013, the World Health Organization (WHO) cited HITAP as a research institute that was pivotal for the advancement of Universal Health Coverage (UHC) and, in 2019, the Wellcome Trust and Overseas Development Institute of the United Kingdom acknowledged HITAP as a health innovation to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
