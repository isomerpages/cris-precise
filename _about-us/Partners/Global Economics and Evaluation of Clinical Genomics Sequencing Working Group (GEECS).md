<p>The Global Economics and Evaluation of Clinical Genomics Sequencing Working
Group (GEECS), founded in 2017, aims to improve the methods used for assessing
the value and implementation of new genomic technologies – specifically,
clinical genomics testing using next-generation sequencing (NGS). GEECS
includes an esteemed group of health economists and policy researchers
from major institutions across the globe who have been at the forefront
of the incorporation of genomics into clinical care. The Working Group
includes the founding members as well as affiliated members who provide
a range of perspectives from different disciplines and countries.
<br>
<br>​GEECS has led several collaborations resulting in a series of publications
in Value in Health, Health Affairs, and JAMA. These articles address challenges
in assessing the value and implementation of NGS, and suggest innovative
solutions to move the value assessment process forward for precision medicine.
These recommendations can be applied not only by health economics researchers,
but also by other stakeholders including health technology assessment organizations,
payers, clinical researchers, and the biotechnology and pharmaceutical
industries.
<br>
<br>​GEECS first published several theme issues and journal themed sections
in 2018 on assessing the value of precision medicine and next-generation
sequencing tests. In 2020, GEECS focused on moving the evaluation of precision
medicine into practice, resulting in a themed section and a JAMA paper
on the global availability and funding of clinical genomic sequencing.
GEECS is continuing its work on value assessment with an emphasis on building
the necessary infrastructure for use across the globe.</p>
