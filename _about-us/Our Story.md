This strategy will be implemented as three phases.</p><p>Phase 1 of Singapore’s National Precision Medicine (NPM) programme set the stage by establishing a Singaporean reference database containing 10,000 genomes, and partnering with industry as co-investors in the NPM programme.</p><p>Phase 2 was launched in 2020 and aims to generate the genomes of 100,000 healthy Singaporeans and 50,000 people with specific diseases. Phase 2 will pilot clinical implementation of precision medicine approaches and establish data infrastructure for the linkage of genomic data with electronic health records and other data types. Precision Health Research, Singapore (PRECISE) is the central entity incorporated to coordinate Phase 2.</p><p>Phase 3 will implement precision medicine in Singapore on a large scale and is expected to span from 2025 to 2030. Besides genomic sequencing of approximately 10% of Singapore's population, the genomic data will be linked with clinical and lifestyle data to create large Singaporean databases. Ultimately, doctors and scientists can use these valuable resources to reach a deeper understanding of how diseases develop, and discover better ways to prevent and treat them.</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/About%20Us/Our%20Story/npm%20phases.png"></div><h3><strong>Video: Singapore's National Precision Medicine Strategy</strong></h3><div class="iframe-wrapper"><iframe height="315" width="560" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xOhIPWFo12Y?si=6ZkHiJAoEgZe60in"></iframe></div><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Banners/banners_page%20footer%203%20-%20purple.png"></div><p></p>
