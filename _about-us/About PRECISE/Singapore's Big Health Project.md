<h4><strong>About National Precision Medicine</strong></h4>
<p>Precision Health Research, Singapore (PRECISE) is the national central
entity coordinating Singapore’s multi-phase National Precision Medicine
(NPM) programme. Established to drive a whole-of-Singapore effort, PRECISE
works with research, clinical, and industry partners to generate insights
into Asian genomics and translate these into better health outcomes and
economic opportunities.</p>
<p>NPM Phase II sequenced 100,000 Singaporeans and conducted clinical implementation
studies, linking genomic, lifestyle, and healthcare data to deepen understanding
of Asian diseases. NPM Phase III, now underway is conducted in partnership
with Singapore’s three healthcare clusters. Focusing on patient participants
in clinical settings, Phase III will evaluate how genomics can be applied
in practice to inform national health strategies, creating opportunities
for innovation in diagnostics, therapeutics, and digital health.</p>
