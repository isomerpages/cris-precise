<h4><strong>Near-Term</strong></h4>
<p>As the PRECISE-SG100K resource is being generated and curated, we are
facilitating early data access for:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Investigator Initiated Studies</strong>. Funded by an NMRC OF-LCG grant that brought together four longitudinal cohorts in Singapore, the
SG100K cohort is an Investigator-Initiated Study focused on determinants
and prediction of cardiovascular disease and diabetes in Asian populations.
To fulfil the grant award obligations and deliverables, the researchers
from SG100K Institutions who have created the SG100K cohort have an initial
period of priority to pursue research on these chronic conditions.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Call for Proposals.</strong> To enable research across a wide range
of use cases beyond cardiovascular disease and diabetes, early access to
the intermediate data release of 50,000 participants by Singapore public
academic and clinical researchers was enabled through an open <a href="https:/call-for-proposals-2026/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Call for Proposals</a> (application
closed in January 2024). The PRECISE-SG100K Scientific Committee selected
36 projects, comprising 8 Flagship Projects and 28 Driver Projects.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategic Industry Partnerships</strong>. Coordinated by PRECISE
Business Development Team, strategic industry collaborations are being
established to strengthen precision medicine research capacity and capability
in Singapore.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Mid-Term</strong></h4>
<p>We anticipate that the PRECISE-SG100K dataset will become broadly open
to Singapore public academic and clinical researchers directly through
the TRUST platform from 2027.</p>
<p>Access by overseas researchers or industry partners will remain contingent
on the application being led by a Singapore research team.</p>
<p>All applications that request use of linked electronic health records
will be subject to additional review by <a href="https://trustplatform.sg/about-us/governance/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">TRUST DAC</a>.</p>
<h4><strong>Early Access Mechanisms (2024 – 2026)</strong></h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong><u>Access by public researchers in Singapore</u></strong>: PRECISE-SG100K
will launch a 2<sup>nd</sup> Call for Proposals in first half of 2026 to
provide early access to the PRECISE-SG100K resource of 100,000 participants
dataset. This 2<sup>nd</sup> Call for Proposals is open only to Singapore
public academic and clinical researchers.</p>
<p>Please check the <a href="http://www.npm.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">PRECISE website</a> and newsletters regularly for
updates on the 2<sup>nd</sup> Call for Proposals. Until then, PRECISE-SG100K
is not actively accepting new research proposals.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><u>Requests from strategic national programmes</u></strong>: PRECISE-SG100K
recognises that research proposals and data access requests from strategic
national programmes will arise periodically. We welcome these requests
for review.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Please direct enquiries to <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">research@precise.cris.sg</a>.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><u>Requests involving overseas collaborators or industry partners</u></strong>:
During the early access period (2024 – 2026), research proposals and data
access requests involving overseas collaborators or industry partners are
reviewed by PRECISE-SG100K on a case-by-case basis, with the expectation
that the overseas collaborator or industry partner must demonstrate return
of tangible benefits to Singapore.</p>
