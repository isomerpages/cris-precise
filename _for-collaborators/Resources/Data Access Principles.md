<h3><strong>Our Commitment to Responsible Data Sharing</strong></h3>
<p>The PRECISE-SG100K resource is a unique multi-ancestry Asian population
cohort dataset of ~100,000 Singaporean residents, jointly created by PRECISE,
SG100K Institutions and GIS.</p>
<p>As joint stewards of this national resource, PRECISE and the SG100K PIs
strive to maximise public good from the PRECISE-SG100K dataset while respecting
participant consent and privacy, upholding scientific rigour, aligning
with national priorities, and fulfilling commitments to funders and existing
collaborators.</p>
<h3><strong>About the PRECISE-SG100K Resource</strong></h3>
<p>SG100K reached the milestone of recruiting 100,000 participants in Apr
2025 and whole genome sequencing of these participants was completed in
Jun 2025. All data components are currently undergoing extensive quality
checks and curation, both prior to <em>and</em> following linkage to electronic
health records on the TRUST platform.</p>
<p>The first release of the integrated dataset for 100,000 participants is
projected to be released in the first half of 2026.</p>
<p>The PRECISE-SG100K integrated dataset includes:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Research phenotype data</strong> from four longitudinal population
health cohorts (“SG100K Institutions”) supported by the SG100K OF-LCG award:</p>

<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Whole genome sequencing</strong> (short read 30X coverage sequencing)
generated in partnership with the Genome Institute of Singapore (GIS, A*STAR)
under Phase II of Singapore’s National Precision Medicine Programme.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><em>SG100K Institutions, GIS and PRECISE are collectively referred to as “PRECISE-SG100K”.</em>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The PRECISE-SG100K dataset is also linked to<strong> electronic health records (EHRs) </strong>that
includes routinely collected clinical data and other health-related information.
This integrated research dataset is accessible only through the TRUST platform
with additional approval of the TRUST Data Access Committee.</p>
<h3><strong>Principles Governing Access to PRECISE-SG100K Resource</strong></h3>
<p>The guiding principles for accessing the PRECISE-SG100K resource is anchored
on Singapore’s Research, Innovation, Enterprise master plan. Our overarching
goal is to advance precision medicine and related health research and innovation
to improve health outcomes, in Singapore, Asia and the world. We are committed
to the responsible and ethical sharing of data, grounded in principles
of public benefit, participant trust, and scientific transparency.</p>
<p>To achieve these, we will avail de-identified data and research results
through controlled data releases to qualified institutional researchers
and appropriate research projects. This will be done in a manner that safeguards
participant privacy, benefits Singapore, while upholding our ethical obligations,
requirements of data guardians, and our commitments to funders and existing
academic and industry collaborators.&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong><u>Near-term</u></strong></h4>
<p>As the PRECISE-SG100K resource is being generated and curated, we are
facilitating early data access for:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Investigator Initiated Studies</strong>. Funded by an NMRC OF-LCG
grant that brought together four longitudinal cohorts in Singapore, the
SG100K cohort is an Investigator-Initiated Study focused on determinants
and prediction of cardiovascular disease and diabetes in Asian populations.
To fulfil the grant award obligations and deliverables, the researchers
from SG100K Institutions who have created the SG100K cohort have an initial
period of priority to pursue research on these chronic conditions.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Call for Proposals.</strong> To enable research across a wide range
of use cases beyond cardiovascular disease and diabetes, early access to
the intermediate data release of 50,000 participants by Singapore public
academic and clinical researchers was enabled through an open <a href="https://npm.sg/research/call-for-proposals/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Call for Proposals</a> (application
closed in January 2024). The PRECISE-SG100K Scientific Committee selected
36 projects, comprising 8 Flagship Projects and 28 Driver Projects.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategic Industry Partnerships</strong>. Coordinated by PRECISE
Business Development Team, strategic industry collaborations are being
established to strengthen precision medicine research capacity and capability
in Singapore.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong><u>Mid-term</u></strong></h4>
<p>We anticipate that the PRECISE-SG100K dataset will become broadly open
to Singapore public academic and clinical researchers directly through
the TRUST platform from 2027.</p>
<p>Access by overseas researchers or industry partners will remain contingent
on the application being led by a Singapore research team.</p>
<p>All applications that request use of linked electronic health records
will be subject to additional review by <a href="https://trustplatform.sg/about-us/governance/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">TRUST DAC</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>Early Access Mechanisms (2024 – 2026)</strong></h3>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong><u>Access by public researchers in Singapore</u></strong>: PRECISE-SG100K
will launch a 2<sup>nd</sup> Call for Proposals in first half of 2026 to
provide early access to the PRECISE-SG100K resource of 100,000 participants
dataset. This 2<sup>nd</sup> Call for Proposals is open only to Singapore
public academic and clinical researchers.</p>
<p>Please check the <a href="http://www.npm.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">PRECISE website</a> and newsletters regularly for
updates on the 2<sup>nd</sup> Call for Proposals. Until then, PRECISE-SG100K
is not actively accepting new research proposals.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><u>Requests from strategic national programmes</u></strong>: PRECISE-SG100K
recognises that research proposals and data access requests from strategic
national programmes will arise periodically. We welcome these requests
for review.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Please direct enquiries to <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">research@precise.cris.sg</a>.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><u>Requests involving overseas collaborators or industry partners</u></strong>:
During the early access period (2024 – 2026), research proposals and data
access requests involving overseas collaborators or industry partners are
reviewed by PRECISE-SG100K on a case-by-case basis, with the expectation
that the overseas collaborator or industry partner must demonstrate return
of tangible benefits to Singapore.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Please direct enquiries to <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">research@precise.cris.sg</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Data Access Governance</strong></h3>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The <u>PRECISE Management Team,</u> which includes both the Executive Director
of PRECISE and the Lead PI of the SG100K study, performs an initial evaluation
of research proposals and data access requests from: i) strategic national
programmes and ii) overseas academic collaborations. Where necessary, the
Management Team consults relevant ecosystem stakeholders before recommending
proposals for review by the PRECISE-SG100K Scientific Committee and PRECISE-SG100K
Data Access Committee.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <u>PRECISE-SG100K Scientific Committee</u> reviews and endorses research
proposals based on strategic and/or scientific merit. The Scientific Committee
may inform applicants of any competing or overlapping research interest
with existing approved projects; these may include overlaps with SG100K
cohort’s research on cardiovascular disease and diabetes.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <u>PRECISE-SG100K Data Access Committee (DAC)</u> reviews and approves
data access requests to the PRECISE-SG100K resource that <u>do not</u> require
linkage to electronic health records (EHR)* to ensure they are in line
with the permitted use of the dataset and are intended for public good.</p>
<p></p>
<p>*<em>Access to linked EHR data on TRUST will require additional approval by the <a href="https://trustplatform.sg/about-us/governance/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">TRUST DAC</a> which assess the projects based on public interest and benefit to Singapore.</em>
</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <u>PRECISE Business Development Team</u> reviews research proposals
and data access requests with industry involvement or collaboration, in
consultation with relevant ecosystem stakeholders if needed, before they
are submitted for review by the PRECISE-SG100K Scientific Committee and
PRECISE-SG100K Data Access Committee.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <u>PRECISE Chief Scientific Officer’s Office</u> (CSOO) serves as Secretariat
for data access, and is the initial primary point of contact for data availability
and collaboration enquiries. Please contact <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">research@precise.cris.sg</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Please see illustration for PRECISE-SG100K Data Access Governance process below.</em>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Matters Pertaining to Publication Policy and Intellectual Property</strong></h3>
<p>All publications arising from the current early access route must be reviewed
by the PRECISE-SG100K Data Access Committee and PRECISE-SG100K Scientific
Committee prior to submission to confirm that the data use and publication
objectives are within the scope of the approved data request. Projects
involving use of TRUST data will also require pre-publication review by
TRUST.</p>
<p>Researchers shall follow the authorship and acknowledgement instructions
listed in the Data Access Agreement.</p>
<p>PRECISE-SG100K will not claim rights to inventions and associated Intellectual
Property Rights (IPRs) developed by researchers using the PRECISE-SG100K
resource, unless the team and/or its members had made inventive contribution
to the development of the IPs. Any resulting IPRs must not unreasonably
restrict access to the dataset for academic research and healthcare purposes.</p>
<h3><strong>Exclusions</strong></h3>
<p>Biological samples collected from SG100K are under the custodianship of
the respective population cohorts. Access to biological samples require
approval from the individual population cohorts. Given that samples are
a finite resource, SG100K prioritises:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Assays conducted on all participants or a large subset of randomly selected
participants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Validated assay methodologies with minimal depletion and maximal output.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Newly generated data must be returned in full to the SG100K cohort(s)
contributing the samples, along with a sublicensable, non-exclusive license
for the SG100K cohort(s) to use the data in future research. Any additional
requirements around sample access must be negotiated and agreed with the
SG100K cohort(s) prior to sample release. PRECISE is pleased to facilitate
introductions and discussions for access to biological samples from more
than one cohort. For access to biological samples from a single cohort,
applicants should approach the individual cohorts directly.</p>
<p>Similarly, access to other SG100K cohort resources, including various
additional datasets, generation of new phenotypic information and participant
recontact, is under the purview of the individual SG100K cohorts.</p>
<p>Please contact <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">research@precise.cris.sg</a> for
more information.</p>
<p>While PRECISE-SG100K does not currently support linkages to other cohorts
or datasets, we welcome suggestions for future data linkage opportunities.</p>
<p>Additional research phenotype or molecular data will be generated with
various (new) funding sources. These data will be made accessible to the
broader research community after fulfilling exclusivity (priority) periods
or access requirements jointly established by the funders and PRECISE-SG100K.</p>
<h3><strong>Disclaimer</strong></h3>
<p>PRECISE-SG100K recognises that it is impossible for these guiding principles
to cover all scenarios and reserves the right to update them from-time-to-time.</p>
<p>These guiding principles are not intended to be cover all details related
to data access. For questions or more information, please email the Secretariat
