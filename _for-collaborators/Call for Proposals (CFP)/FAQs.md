<h4><strong>2. What data will be accessible as part of CFP 2026?</strong></h4>
<p>Approved<strong> </strong>projects will have access to the comprehensive
PRECISE-SG100K linked resource, which includes:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">

<p>Genomic data from whole genome sequencing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clinical data from Singapore's public healthcare providers, maintained
by the Ministry of Health</p>

</ul>
<p>Data will be accessible via the TRUST platform following established data
governance protocols. The release will comprise curated, analysis-ready
datasets that have undergone quality control and standardisation processes.
Raw data files and unprocessed source data are not included in this data
release.</p>
