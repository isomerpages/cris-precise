<p><strong>(Call Launch: 2 January 2026. Please check the 'Resources' section to download the application form.)</strong>
</p>
<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>
<p>The PRECISE-SG100K resource is a unique multi-ancestry Asian population
cohort dataset comprising ~100,000 Singaporean men and women. The resource
provides an opportunity to advance precision medicine and related health
research, in Singapore, Asia and the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of our first open Call for Proposals in 2024 (CFP 2024), early
access to the intermediate data release of 50,000 participants was enabled
for Singapore public academic and clinical researchers. The PRECISE-SG100K
Scientific Committee selected 37 projects, comprising 9 Flagship Projects
and 28 Driver Projects (Details on the projects are available <a href="/files/PRECISE_SG100K_Flagship_and_Driver_Projects_10Nov2025.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>).</p>
<p>Building on the success of CFP 2024, and in anticipation of releasing
baseline data for all ~100,000 participants, PRECISE-SG100K is planning
a second Call for Proposals (CFP 2026). Upon launch of this Call, we invite
researchers in Singapore to submit proposals that make use of the unique
PRECISE-SG100K dataset to advance scientific knowledge and clinical translation.</p>
<p><strong>Important Updates for Existing Projects</strong>:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Current Flagship and Driver Projects approved under CFP 2024 will directly
receive access to the PRECISE-SG100K baseline data release comprising all
100,000 participants. No additional application is required for the approved
research scope. All existing terms and conditions will continue to apply.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PIs of existing CFP 2024 Flagship and Driver Projects are eligible to
apply for CFP 2026 if they have completed (manuscript submitted for) their
existing CFP 2024 Projects.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p><em>TRUST (“Trusted Research and Real world-data Utilisation and Sharing Tech” Platform) is a national health-related data governance framework and analytics platform that catalyses health data research and innovation to improve health. It supports public-private partnerships and enables anonymised health-related research and real-world data to be brought together, accessed and used in an expeditious and secure manner.</em>
</p>
<p>The linked PRECISE-SG100K Resource will be accessible on the <a href="https://trustplatform.sg/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">TRUST platform</a>.
All data will be pseudonymised. This means that conventional personal identifiers
such as date of birth, NRIC, and residential address are removed. This
is to preserve the privacy and prevent re-identification of the study participants.</p>
<p><strong>PRECISE-SG100K Summary Statistics</strong>
</p>
<p>Summary Statistics will be made available to Lead-PIs of approved projects
from PRECISE-SG100K affiliate institutions (PRECISE, Nanyang Technological
University, National University of Singapore, SingHealth Institutions and
A*STAR) through a controlled request process, in line with the existing
data exclusivity arrangement. Summary Statistics will be available under
these terms and conditions:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Each PI may request up to 20 specific traits with scientific justification,
and requested traits must align with their approved research scope.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Additional trait requests beyond the 20-trait limit will be considered
case-by-case and subject to additional approval.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sharing of Summary Statistics with third parties and industry involvement
is not permitted.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>Guiding Principles for Proposals</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Scope for Proposals</strong>
</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The primary focus should be analysis of the PRECISE-SG100K Resource.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Research objectives should be focused, ambitious yet achievable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data use must align with participants' broad consent, which covers research
purposes, record linkage, molecular phenotyping, and health-related studies.
All data use must also comply with Institutional Review Board approval.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>External dataset linkages are not currently supported. All approved projects
will receive access to the standard linked PRECISE-SG100K Resource.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Proposals that seek to generate bulk analysis of the data (e.g. GWAS across
a large number of traits) without clear scientific focus are&nbsp;unlikely&nbsp;to
be supported.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Submitted proposals should <strong>not overlap</strong> with<strong> existing </strong>approved
<a href="/files/PRECISE_SG100K_Flagship_and_Driver_Projects_10Nov2025.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">projects</a><strong>.</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Project Team</strong>
</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Lead Principal Investigator (Lead-PI)</strong>&nbsp;– a senior
researcher who takes overall responsibility for ensuring the research is
completed as described in the proposal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Co-Lead Principal Investigators (Co-Lead PIs)</strong>&nbsp;–
senior researchers who will help lead the research described. Maximum two
Co-Lead PIs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Co-Investigators (Co-Is)</strong>&nbsp;– other researchers involved
in completion of the research.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>One researcher will generally be limited to being Lead-PI for no more
than 1 proposal. In addition, Lead-PIs are required to hold a primary appointment
in a local publicly funded institution throughout the duration of the project.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Other Requirements</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>There should be <strong>no</strong>  <strong>direct or indirect industry partnerships </strong>in
the applications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Proposals should aim to deliver at least 1 major scientific publication
within 2 years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Approved projects should provide yearly progress reports to the <a href="/phase-ii-precise-sg100k/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_self">PRECISE-SG100K Scientific Committee</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Applicants should ensure sufficient funding for their research activities
and associated compute costs including analyses on the TRUST platform. <strong>No funding will be provided through this Call.</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where submitted proposals overlap, the PRECISE-SG100K Scientific Committee
may encourage the researchers to converge them into a single proposal.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Publication Policy</strong></h3>
<p>Publications arising from the proposals should include an author list
that adopts the following principles:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Project team should lead the author list. We highly encourage the following
practices:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Junior colleagues at the front, Seniors at the back</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use authorship generously to share success equitably</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The authorship list should also include collaborators and members who
have helped to create and guide the development of the PRECISE-SG100K Resource.
This includes:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>PRECISE Management Team (up to 3 members)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PRECISE-SG100K Scientific Committee (2 members)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PRECISE-SG100K Data Science Team (2 researchers)</p>

PRECISE-SG100K researchers not included in the primary author list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Acknowledgements: The manuscript<strong> MUST </strong>include an approved
PRECISE-SG100K acknowledgement text. Please check with PRECISE Programme
Managers for the approved text at <a href="mailto:research@precise.cris.sg" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">research@precise.cris.sg</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All manuscripts <strong>MUST</strong> be shared with and approved by the
PRECISE-SG100K Scientific Committee prior to journal submission to ensure
that they respect the principles of co-authorship and appropriate data
sharing (no large-scale sharing of Summary Statistics).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition, any publications arising from the research would need to
undergo pre-publication review by TRUST Data Concierge as well.
<br>Please submit the completed pre-publication review form (together with
your manuscript) from this <a href="https://go.gov.sg/trust-import-export" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">link</a> at
least 21 days in advance:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3><strong>Review Process</strong></h3>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>All proposals will be reviewed by the <a href="/phase-ii-precise-sg100k/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_self">PRECISE-SG100K Scientific Committee</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The guiding principle adopted by the PRECISE-SG100K Scientific Committee
is to maximise use of the Resource and to optimise the quality of the science
carried out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PRECISE-SG100K Scientific Committee may make suggestions for ways in which
the research could be strengthened or may ask groups to work together if
their proposals are overlapping.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Projects that are out of scope (e.g. do not align with participant consents)
will be declined.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>All approved projects that require individual-level data will need to additionally apply for data access to TRUST DAC.</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PRECISE-SG100K Scientific Committee’s decisions will be final on all matters
related to Call for Proposals 2026.</p>
</li>
