<p><strong>PRECISE</strong> rolled out its CIP Grant Call in Jul 2021 to provide
funding for pilots which facilitate the incorporation of genetic/genomic
tests into clinical pathways that improve patient outcomes while maintaining
sustainable per capita cost and optimising the healthcare experiences for
both healthcare providers and patients. This aligns with the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthiersg.gov.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>Ministry of Health’s Healthier SG</u></a>&nbsp;strategy,
leading to better patient outcomes through early detection, accurate diagnosis,
and targeted treatments.</p>
<p>The objectives of the CIP grant call were to:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Achieve progress towards Singapore’s RIE 2025 HHP goals and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inform policy decision-making for implementation in the local healthcare
system</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>PRECISE has awarded 5 CIPs in :&nbsp;<strong>Breast Cancer, Hereditary &amp; Familial Cancers, Familial Hypercholesterolemia, Primary Glomerular Diseases and Pharmacogenomics.</strong>&nbsp;These
CIPs will seek to embed clinical application of genetic/genomic tests to
diagnose, manage and/or treat a particular patient cohort(s) and/or population
for their specific conditions or disease phenotypes.</p>

both genetic and non-genetic factors, to stratify participants to differing
risks of developing breast cancer with the corresponding breast health

screening paradigm will be assessed, with the aim to ultimately empower
educated decisions in screening frequencies to suit personal risk levels
to increase participation in routine screening and to optimise efficiency
and cost.</p>

<p>This pilot aims to implement genetic testing for glomerular diseases in
the clinics for Singapore. It also aims to evaluate the cost-effectiveness
of genetic testing for glomerular diseases in the local context set against
international guidelines. International guidelines have highly recommended
genetic testing early in the workup of selected glomerular diseases in
adults and children. Genetic testing will be provided to individuals with
glomerular diseases, where the treatment plans can be better adjusted,
thereby reducing unnecessary risks of immunosuppression to those will not
benefit. Specific early interventions, made possible only by early genetic
diagnosis, can also be instituted as a result of genetic testing, and they
have also been shown to potentially delay kidney failure by more than 2
decades.</p>
