description: Awarded projects for long read sequencing
third_nav_title: Long Read Sequencing
---
<p>In March 2024, PRECISE launched an open Call for Sample Submission for
Long-read Sequencing. This initiative invited Singapore-based researchers
to submit proposals for sequencing human genomic DNA samples using PacBio's
SMRT cells.</p>
<p>The Evaluation Committee selected four projects that showcased the value
of long-read sequencing in genetics and diagnosis, and novel applications
to improve population health.</p>
