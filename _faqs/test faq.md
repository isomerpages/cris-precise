<p>##### 1. HOW CAN I PARTICIPATE IN THE NATIONAL PRECISION MEDICINE PROGRAMME?</p>
<p>We are working with the SG100K study to bring participants into the precision
medicine programme. SG100K is a state-of-the-art population health research
study, established as a collaboration between leading researchers at Singapore’s
National Universities and hospitals. SG100K is coordinated by Professor
John Chambers at LKC Medicine, NTU. Participation in SG100K involves completing
a consent form and providing blood for genomic sequencing and biological
samples for a range of other analyses. The team will also ask you for your
permission to access your health records and other questions about your
health and lifestyle to help us understand how these factors influence
Singaporeans’ health.</p>
<p>For more information, please visit the SG100K website [here](<a href="https://www.healthforlife.sg/Home" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.healthforlife.sg/Home</a>).</p>
<p>##### 2. WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF GENOMIC SEQUENCING?</p>
<p>Genomic sequencing will produce a map of each person’s genes and the differences
in these genes from person to person. These differences, which are called
genetic variants, influence the physical characteristics of each person,
how they respond to food, medications and their environment, as well as
their risk of developing disease. Having these genetic variant maps of
many people in Singapore will help researchers to study how we develop
diseases and to design more targeted treatments for these diseases.</p>
<p>##### 3. HOW CAN I GET PRESCRIBED PRECISION MEDICINE?</p>
<p>Precision medicine is not available over the counter. Rather, precision
medicine is an approach that uses results from genetic tests to help doctors
put together a plan for care that usually involves very specific recommendations.
In some cases, precision medicine can help make a more accurate diagnosis
and improve treatment. In other cases, it can help people make decisions
about healthy habits, earlier screening tests and other steps towards prevention
if they are at risk for a particular disease.</p>
<p>Currently, precision medicine approaches such as genetic testing are being
used to diagnose some cancers and rare diseases. Research is ongoing to
expand the types of diseases that can benefit from precision medicine approaches
in the future. To achieve this, we have planned several pilot studies to
investigate the large scale implementation of precision medicine in clinics
and hospitals, as well as to evaluate its health and economic benefits.</p>
<p>##### 4. HOW WILL THE DATA THAT I CONTRIBUTE BE USED?</p>
<p>Scientists and doctors will use the data to increase their understanding
of how diseases develop and why some Singaporeans develop a disease, while
others do not. Based on this understanding, scientists and doctors will
be able to develop more targeted preventions and treatments for diseases,
which may be more effective than current therapies and will benefit Singaporeans
in the future.</p>
<p>##### 5. HOW WILL THE PROGRAMME KEEP THE DATA THAT I CONTRIBUTE SECURE
AND PROTECT MY PRIVACY?</p>
<p>Security and privacy are of utmost importance and will be strictly managed.
Firstly, any personal information that identifies you, such as name, NRIC
and address, will be removed from the data that you contribute. Secondly,
this de-identified data will be accessed in a safe and secure manner by
researchers who will use it for research that aligns with the national
objective to deliver better healthcare outcomes for Singaporeans. These
researchers will not know that the data they access is associated with
you.</p>
<p>##### 6. WILL INSURANCE COMPANIES OR EMPLOYERS BE ABLE TO USE THE DATA
(IF THEY OBTAINED IT SOMEHOW) TO DISCRIMINATE AGAINST ME?</p>
<p>No, insurance companies or employers cannot use the data contributed by
you to discriminate against you. Insurance companies need to abide by the
relevant laws that prohibit unfair discrimination. Employers have to adhere
to the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices (TGFEP), which
prohibits any form of discrimination based on factors that are not related
to merit, such as skills, experience or ability to perform the job.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Health (MOH) and the Life Insurance Association (LIA)
have developed the ‘Moratorium on Genetic Testing and Insurance’ to support
Precision Medicine (PM) in Singapore. The Moratorium aims to prevent individuals
from being deterred to undergo clinical genetic tests for any medical indications
and/or participating in PM research due to concerns about insurability.
With effect from 27 October 2021, life insurers in Singapore are not allowed
to use predictive genetic test results in assessing or deciding the outcomes
of insurance applications, unless certain criteria are satisfied.</p>
<p>For more information, please head over to MOH’s announcement – Moratorium
on Genetic Testing &amp; Insurance.</p>

<p>##### 7. DO OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE PRECISION MEDICINE PROGRAMMES? IF SO,
HOW IS SINGAPORE’S DIFFERENT?</p>
<p>Several countries including the U.S., Canada, U.K., China and Japan, have
started national precision medicine programmes and most of these are in
their early days. Based on initial findings, it is becoming increasingly
obvious there are diseases more common in Asians than in Caucasians and
this is largely attributed to the genetic differences between races, yet
the Asian genetic makeup is not extensively studied and poorly understood.
This “Asian genetic diversity gap” has hindered efforts to discover disease-associated
genes that impact Asians.</p>
<p>The Singapore precision medicine programme aims to help fill this “genetic
diversity gap” and facilitate the discovery of more effective preventions
and treatments for Asian populations.</p>
<p>##### 8. WHAT’S COMING UP NEXT FOR THE PRECISION MEDICINE PROGRAMME?</p>
<p>The programme spans 10 years. We have completed the first phase, in which
we studied the genomes of 10,000 Singaporeans and identified common genetic
variants (&gt;1%) that occur in the Singaporean population. In the next
few years, we hope to collect data from 100,000 Singaporeans to reveal
more uniquely Singaporean insights into the roles of genetic variants in
disease. Another important focus will be testing precision medicine pilot
programmes in real hospital settings. In the long run, we also hope to
train future generations of skilled workers in the high-growth genomics
and big data industries, who will help to propel Singapore to the forefront
of precision medicine worldwide.</p>
