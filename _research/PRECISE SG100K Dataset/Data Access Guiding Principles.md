<h3><strong>Our Commitment to Responsible Data Sharing</strong></h3>
<p>PRECISE and the SG100K investigators have jointly created the PRECISE-SG100K
resource (dataset).</p>
<p>As joint stewards of this national resource, PRECISE and the SG100K Principal
Investigators (PIs) strive to maximise the public good from the PRECISE-SG100K
dataset while ensuring respect for participant consent, privacy, scientific
rigour and alignment with national priorities, while at the same time fulfilling
commitments to funders and existing collaborators.</p>
<h3><strong>About the PRECISE-SG100K Resource</strong></h3>
<p>SG100K research teams reached the milestone of 100,000 participants in
Apr 2025; whole genome sequencing of these participants was completed in
Jun 2025. All data components are currently undergoing extensive quality
checks and curation both before <em>and</em> after linkage to electronic
health records on the TRUST platform.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The PRECISE-SG100K resource is a unique multi-ancestry Asian population
cohort dataset of ~100,000 Singaporean residents. The first release of
the integrated dataset for 100,000 participants is projected to be in the
1<sup>st</sup> half of 2026.</p>
