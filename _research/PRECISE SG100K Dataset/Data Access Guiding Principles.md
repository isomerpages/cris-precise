<h3><strong>Our Commitment to Responsible Data Sharing</strong></h3>
<p>PRECISE and the SG100K investigators have jointly created the PRECISE-SG100K
resource (dataset).</p>
<p>As joint stewards of this national resource, PRECISE and the SG100K Principal
Investigators (PIs) strive to maximise the public good from the PRECISE-SG100K
dataset while ensuring respect for participant consent, privacy, scientific
rigour and alignment with national priorities, while at the same time fulfilling
commitments to funders and existing collaborators.</p>
<h3><strong>About the PRECISE-SG100K Resource</strong></h3>
<p>SG100K research teams reached the milestone of 100,000 participants in
Apr 2025; whole genome sequencing of these participants was completed in
Jun 2025. All data components are currently undergoing extensive quality
checks and curation both before <em>and</em> after linkage to electronic
health records on the TRUST platform.</p>
<p>The PRECISE-SG100K resource is a unique multi-ancestry Asian population
cohort dataset of ~100,000 Singaporean residents. The first release of
the integrated dataset for 100,000 participants is projected to be in the
1<sup>st</sup> half of 2026.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The PRECISE-SG100K integrated dataset includes:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Research phenotype data</strong> from four longitudinal population
health cohorts (“SG100K Institutions”) supported by the SG100K OF-LCG award:</p>

<p></p>
<p>With participant consent, and approval from the relevant MOH data guardians,
the PRECISE-SG100K dataset is also linked to<strong> Electronic Health Records (EHRs), </strong>including
routinely collected clinical data and other health-related information.
This integrated research dataset can only be accessed through the TRUST
platform, and with the additional approval of the TRUST Data Access Committee.</p>

<p></p>
<h3><strong>Principles Governing Access to PRECISE-SG100K Resource</strong></h3>
<p>The guiding principles for accessing the PRECISE-SG100K resource is anchored
on Singapore’s Research, Innovation, Enterprise master plan. Our overarching
goal is to advance precision medicine and related health research and innovation
to improve health outcomes, in Singapore, Asia and the world. We are committed
to the responsible and ethical sharing of data, grounded in principles
of public benefit, participant trust, and scientific transparency.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To achieve these, we will avail de-identified data and research results
through controlled data releases to qualified institutional researchers
and suitable research projects, in a manner that preserves participant
privacy and brings benefit to Singapore, while respecting our ethical obligations,
requirements of data guardians, and commitments to funders and existing
academic and industry collaborators.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Short-term</strong></h4>
<p>While the PRECISE-SG100K resource is being generated and curated, we are
facilitating early data access for:</p>
<p></p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Investigator Initiated Studies</strong>. The SG100K Cohort is
an Investigator-Initiated Study, funded by an NMRC OF-LCG grant focused
on determinants and prediction of <u>cardiovascular disease and diabetes</u> in
Asian populations. Based on this grant award, the researchers from SG100K
Institutions who have created the SG100K Cohort have an initial period
of priority to pursue research on these chronic conditions.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Call for Proposals.</strong> To enable research across a wide range
of use cases beyond cardiovascular disease and diabetes, early access to
the intermediate release of 50,000 participants dataset by Singapore public
academic and clinical researchers was enabled through an open Call for
Proposals (application closed in January 2024). The PRECISE-SG100K Scientific
Committee selected 36 projects, comprising eight Flagship Projects and
another 28 Driver Projects. Please refer to url for more details.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Strategic Industry Partnerships</strong>. Coordinated by PRECISE
Business Development Team, strategic industry collaborations are being
established to strengthen precision medicine research capacity and capability
in Singapore.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Mid-term</strong></h4>
<p>We anticipate that the PRECISE-SG100K resource of 100,000 participants
will become broadly open to Singapore public academic and clinical researchers
directly through the TRUST platform from 2027.</p>
<p></p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Access by overseas researchers or industry partners will remain contingent
on the application being led by a Singapore research team.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All applications that request use of linked electronic health records
will be subject to additional review by TRUST.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Early Access Mechanisms (2024 – 2026)</strong></h4>
<p></p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong><u>Access by public researchers in Singapore</u></strong>: PRECISE-SG100K
will launch a 2<sup>nd</sup> Call for Proposals in 1H2026 providing early
access to the PRECISE-SG100K resource of 100,000 participants dataset.
This 2<sup>nd</sup> Call for Proposals is open only to Singapore public
academic and clinical researchers.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Please check the <a href="http://www.npm.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">PRECISE website</a> and newsletters regularly for
updates on the 2<sup>nd</sup> Call for Proposals. Until then, PRECISE-SG100K
is not actively accepting new research proposals.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><u>Requests from strategic national programmes</u></strong>: PRECISE-SG100K
recognises that research proposals and data access requests from strategic
national programmes will arise periodically. We welcome these requests
for review.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Please direct enquiries to <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">research@precise.cris.sg</a>.</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong><u>Requests involving overseas collaborators or industry partners</u></strong>:
During the early access period (2024 – 2026), research proposals and data
access requests involving overseas collaborators or industry partners are
reviewed by PRECISE-SG100K on a case-by-case basis, with the expectation
that the overseas collaborator or industry partner must demonstrate return
of tangible benefits to Singapore.</p>

</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Data Access Governance</strong></h3>
<p>The <u>PRECISE Management Team,</u> which includes both the ED of PRECISE
and the Lead PI of the SG100K study, carry out an initial evaluation of
research proposals and data access requests from: i) strategic national
programmes and ii) strategic overseas academic collaborations. Where necessary,
the Management Team consults relevant ecosystem stakeholders, before recommending
proposals for review by the PRECISE-SG100K Scientific Committee and PRECISE-SG100K
Data Access Committee.</p>
<p>The <u>PRECISE-SG100K Scientific Committee</u> reviews and endorses research
proposals based on strategic and/or scientific merit. The Scientific Committee
may inform applicants of any competing or overlapping research interest
with existing approved projects; these may include overlaps with SG100K
Cohort’s research on cardiovascular disease and diabetes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <u>PRECISE-SG100K Data Access Committee (DAC)</u> reviews and approves
data access requests for PRECISE-SG100K resource that <u>do not</u> require
linkage to electronic health records (EHR)* to ensure they are in line
with the permitted use of the dataset and are intended for public good.</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>*Access to linked clinical data on TRUST will require additional approval by the TRUST DAC.</em>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>&nbsp;The <u>PRECISE Business Development Team</u> reviews research proposals
and data access requests with industry involvement or collaboration, in
consultation with relevant ecosystem stakeholders if needed, before they
are submitted for review by the PRECISE-SG100K Scientific Committee and
PRECISE-SG100K Data Access Committee.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <u>PRECISE Chief Scientific Officer’s Office</u> (CSOO) serves as secretariat
for data access, and is the initial primary point of contact for data availability
and collaboration enquiries. Please contact <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">research@precise.cris.sg</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>Matters Pertaining to Publication Policy and Intellectual Property</strong></h3>
<p>All publications arising from the current early access route must be reviewed
by the PRECISE-SG100K Data Access Committee and PRECISE-SG100K Scientific
Committee prior to submission to confirm that the data use and publication
objectives are within the scope of the approved data request.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Researchers shall follow the authorship and acknowledgement instructions
listed in the Data Access Agreement.</p>
<p></p>
<p>PRECISE-SG100K will not claim rights to inventions and associated Intellectual
Property Rights (IPRs) developed by researchers using the PRECISE-SG100K
resource, unless such IPRs are used in a way that unreasonably restrict
health-related research and/or access to healthcare.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>Exclusions</strong></h3>
<p></p>
<p>Biological samples collected from SG100K are under the custodianship of
the respective population health studies. Access to biological samples
require approval from either SG100K Cohort or the relevant population health
study within the SG100K Cohort. Given that samples are a finite resource,
SG100K prioritises:</p>
<p></p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Assays conducted on all participants or a large subset of randomly selected
participants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Validated assay methodologies with minimal depletion and maximal output.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Newly generated data must be returned in full to the SG100K cohort(s)
contributing the samples, along with a sublicensable, non-exclusive license
for the SG100K cohort(s) to use the data in future research. Any additional
requirements around sample access must be negotiated and agreed with the
SG100K cohort(s) prior to sample release. PRECISE is pleased to facilitate
introductions and discussions - applicants can approach the SG100K cohorts
directly for sample access.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Similarly, access to other SG100K cohort resources, including various
additional datasets, generation of new phenotypic information and participant
recontact, is under the purview of the SG100K cohorts.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Please direct enquiries to <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">research@precise.cris.sg</a></strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>While PRECISE-SG100K does not currently support linkages to other cohorts
or datasets, we welcome suggestions for future data linkage opportunities.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Additional research phenotype or molecular data will be generated with
various (new) funding sources. These data will be made accessible to the
broader research community after fulfilling exclusivity (priority) periods
or access requirements jointly established by the funders and PRECISE-SG100K.</p>
<p></p>
