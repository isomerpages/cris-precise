<h3><strong>Call for Proposals for the PRECISE-SG100K dataset</strong></h3>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thank you for your interest.
<br>Please note that the call for proposals is now closed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>PRECISE-SG100K initiated an open Call for Proposals in November 2023 inviting
researchers in Singapore to submit proposals that utilise the rich PRECISE-SG100K
resource and aim to advance scientific knowledge and enable clinical translation.</p>
<p>As part of the call, <strong>28 Driver Projects</strong> were selected based
on the scientific value, deliverables, project plan, and project team.</p>
<p>The PRECISE-SG100K Scientific Committee went through a rigorous evaluation
process to select <strong>8 Flagship Projects </strong>based on their alignment
to the research strategy of the National Precision Medicine programme and
their potential to generate insightful and impactful observations.</p>
<p>These Flagship Projects will be showcased as key research outcomes of
the National Precision Medicine programme and will work closely with the
PRECISE-SG100K Scientific Committee and Data Science Team to establish
Singapore as a leader in the field of Precision Medicine.</p>
<p>Please refer to the list of selected Driver and Flagship Projects below:</p>

<h5><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></h5>
<p>Phase II of the National Precision Medicine (NPM) programme is progressing
well and the PRECISE-SG100K Dataset is developing well.</p>
<p>To date, &gt;80,000 participants have been recruited and whole genome
sequencing for &gt;46,000 have been completed. PRECISE-SG100K is on track
to make the first data freeze comprising data for 50,000 participants available
to the Singapore public research community in Q2 2024. The second data
freeze of all 100,000 participants is likely to be available in Q2 2025.</p>
<p>In anticipation of the first data freeze, we are inviting researchers
in Singapore to submit proposals for&nbsp;<strong>Driver Projects</strong>&nbsp;that
make use of these unique data to advance scientific knowledge and clinical
translation.</p>
<p>Approved Driver Projects will get priority access to the de-identified
clinical, phenotypic, and genomic data of the 100,000 participants in the
SG100K study. They will also get support from PRECISE-SG100K Scientific
Committee (refer below for details of members) and Data Science Team as
well as opportunities to collaborate with pharmaceutical companies who
are partnering the NPM programme.</p>
<h5><strong>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DATASET</strong></h5>
<p>PRECISE-SG100K Dataset includes:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Research Phenotype Data:</strong>&nbsp;Questionnaire responses,
physical measurement, biochemical laboratory assays, and imaging collected
from SG100K participants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Genome Data:</strong>&nbsp;Shotgun Whole Genomic Sequencing (WGS)
derived genomic sequences and variant catalogue of SG100K participants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Clinical Data:</strong>&nbsp;Collected by public healthcare providers
and maintained by the Ministry of Health, Singapore.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>All data will be pseudonymised. This means that conventional personal
identifiers such as date of birth, NRIC, and residential address are removed.
The data and/or human biospecimens thus cannot be easily attributed to
a specific individual.</p>
<h5><strong>GUIDING PRINCIPLES FOR PROPOSAL</strong></h5>
<p><strong>Scope for Proposals</strong>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The primary focus should be analysis of the PRECISE-SG100K Dataset.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data use must fall within Institutional Review Board / data access permissions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Research objectives should be focused, ambitious yet achievable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Proposals that seek to generate bulk analysis of the data (e.g. GWAS across
a large number of traits) without clear scientific focus are&nbsp;unlikely&nbsp;to
be supported.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Proposals should aim to deliver at least 1 major scientific publication
within 2 years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where submitted proposals overlap, the PRECISE-SG100K Scientific Committee
may encourage the researchers to converge them into a single proposal.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Project Team</strong>
</p>
<p>We expect proposals to show collaboration and partnering across Singapore
public institutions. Towards this, the project team should include:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Lead Principal Investigator (Lead-PI)</strong>&nbsp;– a senior
researcher who takes overall responsibility for ensuring the research is
completed as described in the proposal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Co-Lead Principal Investigators (Co-Lead PIs)</strong>&nbsp;–
senior researchers who will help lead the research described. Maximum two
Co-Lead PIs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Co-Investigators (Co-Is)</strong>&nbsp;– other researchers involved
in completion of the research.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>One researcher will generally be limited to being Lead-PI for no more
than 1 proposal. In addition, Lead-PIs are required to hold a primary appointment
in a local publicly funded institution throughout the duration of the project.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Industry Involvement</strong>
</p>
<p>PRECISE anticipates working closely with industry to pursue collaborative
research that advances precision medicine insights. To this end, there
is currently an active process towards creating a consortium with multiple
international pharmaceutical partners.</p>
<p>This leads to two key considerations:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Project Proposals that include an industry partner will require specific
review and approval by PRECISE and the PRECISE-SG100K Scientific Committee,
to ensure that the proposed industry involvement does not conflict with
ongoing industry engagement activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The pharmaceutical partners brought into a collaboration by PRECISE may
seek to pursue similar works to that described in the proposals. PRECISE
will aim to link up these similar research strands, so that Singapore public
researchers and PRECISE pharmaceutical partners can work together where
it adds value. If this happens, it might lead to additional support available
for the selected proposals.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Publication Policy</strong>
</p>
<p>Publications arising from the proposals should include an author list
that adopts the following principles:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Project team should lead the author list. We highly encourage the following
practices:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>“Junior colleagues at the front, Seniors at the back”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use authorship generously to share success equitably</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The authorship list should also include collaborators and members who
have helped to create and guide the development of the PRECISE-SG100K scientific
resource. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>PRECISE Management Team (up to 3 members)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PRECISE-SG100K Scientific Committee (2 members)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PRECISE-SG100K Data Science Team (2 researchers)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PRECISE-SG100K Cohorts</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Up to 2 for Singapore Epidemiology of Eye Diseases (SEED) Study</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Up to 2 for SingHEART Study</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Up to 3 for Health for Life in Singapore (HELIOS) Study, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Up to 3 for Multi-Ethnic Cohort (MEC) Study</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>PRECISE-SG100K Banner: A banner authorship MUST be used to capture other
PRECISE-SG100K researchers not included in the primary author list</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Acknowledgements: The manuscript MUST include an approved PRECISE-SG100K
acknowledgement text. Please check with PRECISE Programme Managers at
<a href="mailto:research@precise.cris.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">research@precise.cris.sg</a>for the approved text.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All manuscripts MUST be shared with and approved by the PRECISE-SG100K
Scientific Committee prior to journal submission to ensure that they respect
these principles.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h5><strong>FLAGSHIP PROJECTS</strong></h5>
<p>Driver Projects have been shortlisted to work more closely with the PRECISE-SG100K
team. These&nbsp;<strong>Flagship Projects</strong>&nbsp;will be selected
based on their alignment to the research strategy for the NPM programme
and their potential to generate insightful and impactful observations.
Flagship projects will receive additional support from PRECISE-SG100K team,
which may include support for computing costs and/or data analysts FTEs.</p>
<p>Flagship Projects will be show-cased as key research outcomes of the NPM
programme and will be expected to meet with the PRECISE-SG100K Scientific
Committee on a regular basis to share their progress.</p>
<h5><strong>REVIEW PROCESS</strong></h5>
<ol>
<li>
<p>All proposals will be reviewed by the PRECISE-SG100K Scientific Committee.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The guiding principle adopted by the PRECISE-SG100K Scientific Committee
is to maximise use of the dataset and to optimise the quality of the science
carried out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PRECISE-SG100K Scientific Committee may make suggestions for ways in which
the research could be strengthened or may ask groups to work together if
their proposals are overlapping.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Projects that are out of scope (e.g. do not align with participant consents)
will be declined.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data access for Flagship Projects will be made available under the PRECISE-SG100K
Umbrella data access approval from TRUST[1] Data Access Committee (DAC).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other approved Driver Projects will need to apply for data access separately
to either TRUST DAC (if clinical data are requested) or the PRECISE-SG100K
DAC (if only research phenotype and/or genomic data are requested).</p>
</li>
