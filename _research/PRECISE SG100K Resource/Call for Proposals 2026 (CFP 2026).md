third_nav_title: PRECISE SG100K Resource
---
<p><strong>(Anticipated Call Launch: 2 January 2026. Check this page for updates)</strong>
</p>
<h4><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></h4>
<p>The PRECISE-SG100K resource is a unique multi-ancestry Asian population
cohort dataset comprising ~100,000 Singaporean men and women. &nbsp;The
resource provides an opportunity to advance precision medicine and related
health research, in Singapore, Asia and the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of our first open Call for Proposals in 2024 (CFP 2024), early
access to the intermediate data release of 50,000 participants was enabled
for Singapore public academic and clinical researchers. The PRECISE-SG100K
Scientific Committee selected 36 projects, comprising 8 Flagship Projects
and 28 Driver Projects (Details on the projects are available here).</p>
<p>Building on the success of CFP 2024, and in anticipation of releasing
baseline data for all ~100,000 participants, PRECISE-SG100K is planning
a second Call for Proposals (CFP 2026). Upon launch of this Call, we invite
researchers in Singapore to submit proposals that make use of the unique
PRECISE-SG100K dataset to advance scientific knowledge and clinical translation.</p>
<p>Important Update for Existing Projects: Current Flagship and Driver Projects
approved under CFP 2024 will directly receive access to the PRECISE-SG100K
baseline data release comprising all 100,000 participants. No additional
application is required for the approved research scope. All existing terms
and conditions will continue to apply.</p>
<h4><strong>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF PRECISE-SG100K RESOURCE</strong></h4>
<p>All approved projects will have access to the standard PRECISE-SG100K
Resource linked to Clinical Data. The linked Resource includes:</p>

<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/precise_sg100k_resource_table.png">
</div>
<p>* Comprehensive details about Clinical Data and other Health-related Data
can be found on the TRUST1 website (https://trustplatform.sg) after registering
as a TRUST member.</p>
<p>The linked PRECISE-SG100K Resource will be accessible on the TRUST platform.
All data will be pseudonymised. This means that conventional personal identifiers
such as date of birth, NRIC, and residential address are removed. This
is to preserve the privacy and prevent re-identification of the study participants.</p>
<p>[1] TRUST (“Trusted Research and Real world-data Utilisation and Sharing
Tech” Platform) is a national health-data exchange platform to facilitate
secure data sharing and analysis of anonymised research and real-world
data to support data analytics between public institutions, and between
the public and private sectors.</p>
<p><strong>PRECISE-SG100K Summary Statistics</strong>
</p>
<p>Summary Statistics will be made available to Lead-PIs of approved projects
from PRECISE-SG100K affiliate institutions (PRECISE, Nanyang Technological
University, National University of Singapore, SingHealth Institutions and
A*STAR) through a controlled request process, in line with the existing
data exclusivity arrangement. Summary Statistics will be available under
these terms and conditions:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Each PI may request up to 20 specific traits with scientific justification,
and requested traits must align with their approved research scope.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Additional trait requests beyond the 20-trait limit will be considered
case-by-case and subject to additional approval.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sharing of Summary Statistics with third parties and industry involvement
is not permitted.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4><strong>GUIDING PRINCIPLES FOR PROPOSAL</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Scope for Proposals</strong>
</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>The primary focus should be analysis of the PRECISE-SG100K Resource.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Research objectives should be focused, ambitious yet achievable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data use must align with participants' broad consent, which covers research
purposes, record linkage, molecular phenotyping, and health-related studies.
All data use must also comply with Institutional Review Board approval.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>External dataset linkages are not currently supported. All approved projects
will receive access to the standard linked PRECISE-SG100K Resource.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Proposals that seek to generate bulk analysis of the data (e.g. GWAS across
a large number of traits) without clear scientific focus are&nbsp;unlikely&nbsp;to
be supported.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Submitted proposals should <strong>not overlap</strong> with<strong> existing </strong>approved <strong><a href="https://www.npm.sg/files/PRECISE_SG100K_Flagship_and_Driver_Projects.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">projects</a>.</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Project Team</strong>
</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Lead Principal Investigator (Lead-PI)</strong>&nbsp;– a senior
researcher who takes overall responsibility for ensuring the research is
completed as described in the proposal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Co-Lead Principal Investigators (Co-Lead PIs)</strong>&nbsp;–
senior researchers who will help lead the research described. Maximum two
Co-Lead PIs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Co-Investigators (Co-Is)</strong>&nbsp;– other researchers involved
in completion of the research.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>One researcher will generally be limited to being Lead-PI for no more
than 1 proposal. In addition, Lead-PIs are required to hold a primary appointment
in a local publicly funded institution throughout the duration of the project.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Other Requirements</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>There should be <strong>no</strong>  <strong>direct or indirect industry partnerships </strong>in
the applications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Proposals should aim to deliver at least 1 major scientific publication
within 2 years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Approved projects should provide yearly progress reports to the PRECISE-SG100K
Scientific Committee.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Applicants should ensure sufficient funding for their research activities
and associated compute costs including analyses on the TRUST platform. <strong>No funding will be provided through this Call.</strong>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where submitted proposals overlap, the PRECISE-SG100K Scientific Committee
may encourage the researchers to converge them into a single proposal.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>PUBLICATION POLICY</strong></h4>
<p>Publications arising from the proposals should include an author list
that adopts the following principles:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Project team should lead the author list. We highly encourage the following
practices:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>“Junior colleagues at the front, Seniors at the back”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use authorship generously to share success equitably</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The authorship list should also include collaborators and members who
have helped to create and guide the development of the PRECISE-SG100K Resource.
This includes:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>PRECISE Management Team (up to 3 members)</p>
</li>
<li>

PRECISE-SG100K researchers not included in the primary author list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Acknowledgements: The manuscript MUST include an approved PRECISE-SG100K
acknowledgement text. Please check with PRECISE Programme Managers for
the approved text at <a href="mailto:research@precise.cris.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">research@precise.cris.sg</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All manuscripts <strong>MUST</strong> be shared with and approved by the
PRECISE-SG100K Scientific Committee prior to journal submission to ensure
that they respect the principles of co-authorship and appropriate data
sharing (no large-scale sharing of Summary Statistics).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4><strong>REVIEW PROCESS</strong></h4>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>All proposals will be reviewed by the PRECISE-SG100K Scientific Committee.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The guiding principle adopted by the PRECISE-SG100K Scientific Committee
is to maximise use of the Resource and to optimise the quality of the science
carried out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PRECISE-SG100K Scientific Committee may make suggestions for ways in which
the research could be strengthened or may ask groups to work together if
their proposals are overlapping.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Projects that are out of scope (e.g. do not align with participant consents)
will be declined.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All approved projects that require individual-level data will need to
additionally apply for data access to TRUST DAC.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PRECISE-SG100K Scientific Committee’s decisions will be final on all matters
related to Call for Proposals 2026.</p>
