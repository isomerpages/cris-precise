<h3>Call for Proposals 2026 (CFP 2026)</h3>
<p><strong>(Anticipated Call Launch: 2 January 2026. Check this page for updates)</strong>
</p>
<h4><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></h4>
<p>The PRECISE-SG100K resource is a unique multi-ancestry Asian population
cohort dataset comprising ~100,000 Singaporean men and women. &nbsp;The
resource provides an opportunity to advance precision medicine and related
health research, in Singapore, Asia and the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of our first open Call for Proposals in 2024 (CFP 2024), early
access to the intermediate data release of 50,000 participants was enabled
for Singapore public academic and clinical researchers. The PRECISE-SG100K
Scientific Committee selected 36 projects, comprising 8 Flagship Projects
and 28 Driver Projects (Details on the projects are available <strong><a href="https://www.npm.sg/files/PRECISE_SG100K_Flagship_and_Driver_Projects.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a></strong>).</p>
<p>Building on the success of CFP 2024, and in anticipation of releasing
baseline data for all ~100,000 participants, PRECISE-SG100K is planning
a second Call for Proposals (CFP 2026). Upon launch of this Call, we invite
researchers in Singapore to submit proposals that make use of the unique
PRECISE-SG100K dataset to advance scientific knowledge and clinical translation.</p>
<p><strong>Important Update for Existing Projects:</strong> Current Flagship
and Driver Projects approved under CFP 2024 will directly receive access
to the PRECISE-SG100K baseline data release comprising all 100,000 participants.
No additional application is required for the approved research scope.
All existing terms and conditions will continue to apply.</p>
<h4><strong>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF PRECISE-SG100K RESOURCE</strong></h4>
<p>All approved projects will have access to the standard PRECISE-SG100K
Resource linked to Clinical Data. The linked Resource includes:</p>

<p>* Comprehensive details about Clinical Data and other Health-related Data
can be found on the TRUST1 website (https://trustplatform.sg) after registering
as a TRUST member.</p>
<p>The linked PRECISE-SG100K Resource will be accessible on the TRUST platform.
All data will be pseudonymised. This means that conventional personal identifiers
such as date of birth, NRIC, and residential address are removed. This
is to preserve the privacy and prevent re-identification of the study participants.</p>
<p>[1] TRUST (“Trusted Research and Real world-data Utilisation and Sharing
Tech” Platform) is a national health-data exchange platform to facilitate
secure data sharing and analysis of anonymised research and real-world
data to support data analytics between public institutions, and between
the public and private sectors.</p>
<p><strong>PRECISE-SG100K Summary Statistics</strong>
</p>
<p>Summary Statistics will be made available to Lead-PIs of approved projects
from PRECISE-SG100K affiliate institutions (PRECISE, Nanyang Technological
University, National University of Singapore, SingHealth Institutions and
A*STAR) through a controlled request process, in line with the existing
data exclusivity arrangement. Summary Statistics will be available under
these terms and conditions:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Each PI may request up to 20 specific traits with scientific justification,
and requested traits must align with their approved research scope.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Additional trait requests beyond the 20-trait limit will be considered
case-by-case and subject to additional approval.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sharing of Summary Statistics with third parties and industry involvement
is not permitted.</p>
