**PRECISE** rolled out its CIP Grant Call in Jul 2021 to provide funding for pilots which facilitate the incorporation of genetic/genomic tests into clinical pathways that improve patient outcomes while maintaining sustainable per capita cost and optimising the healthcare experiences for both healthcare providers and patients. This aligns with the&nbsp;[Ministry of Health’s Healthier SG](https://www.healthiersg.gov.sg/)&nbsp;strategy, leading to better patient outcomes through early detection, accurate diagnosis, and targeted treatments.

The objectives of the CIP grant call were to:

1\. Achieve progress towards&nbsp;[Singapore’s RIE 2025 HHP goals](https://www.nrf.gov.sg/rie2025-plan/human-health-and-potential); and  
2\. Inform policy decision-making for implementation in the local healthcare system

PRECISE has awarded 5 CIPs in :&nbsp;**Breast Cancer, Hereditary &amp; Familial Cancers, Familial Hypercholesterolemia, Primary Glomerular Diseases and Pharmacogenomics.**&nbsp;These CIPs will seek to embed clinical application of genetic/genomic tests to diagnose, manage and/or treat a particular patient cohort(s) and/or population for their specific conditions or disease phenotypes.
