**PRECISE** rolled out its CIP Grant Call in Jul 2021 to provide funding for pilots which facilitate the incorporation of genetic/genomic tests into clinical pathways that improve patient outcomes while maintaining sustainable per capita cost and optimising the healthcare experiences for both healthcare providers and patients. This aligns with the&nbsp;[Ministry of Health’s Healthier SG](https://www.healthiersg.gov.sg/)&nbsp;strategy, leading to better patient outcomes through early detection, accurate diagnosis, and targeted treatments.

The objectives of the CIP grant call were to:

1\. Achieve progress towards&nbsp;[Singapore’s RIE 2025 HHP goals](https://www.nrf.gov.sg/rie2025-plan/human-health-and-potential); and  
2\. Inform policy decision-making for implementation in the local healthcare system

PRECISE has awarded 5 CIPs in :&nbsp;**Breast Cancer, Hereditary &amp; Familial Cancers, Familial Hypercholesterolemia, Primary Glomerular Diseases and Pharmacogenomics.**&nbsp;These CIPs will seek to embed clinical application of genetic/genomic tests to diagnose, manage and/or treat a particular patient cohort(s) and/or population for their specific conditions or disease phenotypes.

				This pilot aims to integrate breast cancer risk prediction tools, incorporating both genetic and non-genetic factors, to stratify participants to differing risks of developing breast cancer with the corresponding breast health recommendations. The feasibility of a personal risk-based breast cancer screening paradigm will be assessed, with the aim to ultimately empower educated decisions in screening frequencies to suit personal risk levels to increase participation in routine screening and to optimise efficiency and cost.
