<h3><strong>Call for Sample Submission for Long Read Sequencing</strong></h3>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thank you for your interest.
<br>Please note that the call for sample submission is now closed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>Introduction</strong></h4>
<p>Long-read sequencing can offer a more complete and detailed view of the
genome by addressing the limitations of short-read sequencing. Its applications
are likely to provide additional insights such as better characterisation
of genomes where structural variations and complex rearrangements are common
and have the capability of detecting DNA methylation patterns at the same
time. These insights are of interest to Singapore as they may uncover novel
regulatory mechanisms and improve our understanding of how environmental
and lifestyle factors interact with our genes to cause disease and aging.</p>
<p>PRECISE would like to extend an invitation to Singapore’s academic research
community to submit research proposals for the opportunity to sequence
human genomic DNA (‘<strong>gDNA</strong>’) samples employing Pacific Bioscience’s
(‘<strong>PacBio</strong>’) <a href="https://www.pacb.com/technology/hifi-sequencing/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">HiFi Long Read Technology</a> using
Single Molecule, Real Time (‘<strong>SMRT</strong>’) cells.</p>
<p><strong><u>PRECISE is not providing any funding for this Call.</u></strong>
</p>
<h4><strong>Research Objectives</strong></h4>
<p>Applicants should aim to submit proposals that demonstrate the value of
long-read sequencing in two key aspects:</p>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Improving understanding of human genetics and diagnosis of unresolved
conditions; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creating novel applications and translational research outcomes to improve
population health and high impact disease conditions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4><strong>Scope of this Call</strong></h4>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>For this Call for Sample Submission, a total of <strong>500</strong> SMRT
cells and accompanying sequencing services (research grade) are available.
The application must specify the number of SMRT cells required for the
proposal and PRECISE will evaluate the number of SMRT cells to be awarded
to each proposal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Principal Investigators (‘<strong>PIs</strong>’) are responsible for submitting
human gDNA samples that meet the Sample Administrative, Preparation, and
Submission Requirements (see Resources). Neither PRECISE, PacBio nor sequencing
provider will be responsible for suboptimal sequencing data as a result
of sample quality issue or providing additional SMRT cells.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Research objectives should be focused, ambitious yet achievable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Proposals should aim to deliver at least one major scientific publication
within two years upon receiving sequencing data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PIs are agreeable to share data with NPM programme by depositing the data
in PRECISE-SG100K genomic archive upon publication.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PIs must acknowledge in the application form that they might need to wait
for up to six months for their samples to be sequenced. PRECISE reserves
the right to revise this timeline in accordance with sample readiness,
quality, and other factors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><u>No funding or other support</u></strong> will be provided from
PRECISE.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h4><strong>Project Team</strong></h4>
<ol data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Lead Principal Investigator (‘<strong>Lead PI</strong>’) is required to
hold a primary appointment in a publicly funded institution in Singapore.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each proposal may have only one Lead PI and a maximum of two co-Lead PIs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Project Team must demonstrate capability to perform data analysis;
collaborators or data analysts may be included if needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><u>No industry collaborations are permitted under this Call</u></strong>.</p>
</li>
