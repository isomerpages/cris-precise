**Precision Medicine research is part of Singapore’s RIE2025 strategic goal to transform and protect the health of every Singaporean.**

Our research will focus on accelerating health research by combining genetic, lifestyle, clinical data and other molecular technologies to understand how these factors impact health and/or contribute to disease.

We hope to generate new findings that will inform healthcare practices with the goal of improving the efficiency and effectiveness of disease prevention, diagnosis and treatment.
